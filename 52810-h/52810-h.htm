<p class="pc4 xlarge">The Border Boys in the<br />Canadian Rockies</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE BOY FROM NOWHERE.</p>

<p>“Hold on there a minute! Don’t you think
you’re being unnecessarily rough with that boy?”</p>

<p>“Naw, I don’t. And if I am, it ain’t none of
your business that I can see.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I mean to make it so.”</p>

<p>“Aw run along and play, kid. Don’t bother
me.”</p>

<p>The brakeman glared angrily at the tall, well-built
lad who had accosted him. In so doing, he
for an instant ceased belaboring a dust-covered,
cowering lad in pitifully ragged clothing whom,
a moment before, he had been cuffing about the
head without mercy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take that, you young tramp!” he had hurled
out savagely, as each blow fell on the quivering
form.</p>

<p>The boy receiving this unmerciful punishment
had been discovered riding the blind-baggage on
the long, dust-covered train of Canadian Pacific
coaches that had just come to a stop.</p>

<p>Of course the boy had been summarily ejected,
and the brakeman was now engaged in what he
would have termed “dusting the young rascal’s
jacket.”</p>

<p>It was a pitiful sight, though, to see the slender,
emaciated lad, whose rags hardly covered his thin
body, and who could not have been much above
sixteen, cowering under the punishment of the
burly trainman. The brakeman was not of necessity
a brute. But in his eyes the lad was “a
miserable tramp,” and only getting his just dues.
To more humane eyes, though, the scene appeared
in a different light.</p>

<p>Some of the passengers, gazing from the windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
had ventured to cry, “Shame,” but that was
all that had come of it till Ralph Stetson, who
had been standing with a group of his friends at
the other end of the platform of the Pine Pass
station, in the heart of the Canadian Rockies,
happened to see what was going forward. Without
a word he had hastened from them and come
to the rescue. Ralph was a boy whose blood always
was on fire at the sight of cruelty and oppression,
and it appeared to him that the brakeman
was being unnecessarily rough. Besides,
there was something in the big, appealing eyes
of the sufferer, and his ragged, ill-clad form, that
aroused all his sympathies. So it came about that
he had tried to check the punishment with the
words quoted at the beginning of this chapter.</p>

<p>Now he stood facing the brakeman who appeared
quite willing for a minute to drop the lad
he was maltreating and turn on the newcomer.
Perhaps, though, there was something in Ralph’s
eye that held him back. Old “King-pin” Stetson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
son looked thoroughly business-like in his
broad-brimmed woolen hat, corduroy jacket and
trousers, stout hunting boots and flannel shirt,
with a handkerchief loosely knotted about the
neck. Evidently he had come prepared to rough
it in the wild country in the midst of which the
train had come to a halt.</p>

<p>His life and experiences in the strenuous country
along the Mexican border had toughened
Ralph’s muscles and bronzed his features, and he
looked well equipped physically to carry out the
confidence expressed in his cool, clear eyes.</p>

<p>“Who are you, anyhow?” the brakeman hurled
at him, growing more aggressive as he saw some
of his mates running toward him from the head
of the long train where the two big Mogul locomotives
were thundering impatiently.</p>

<p>“Never mind that for now. Drop that boy and
I’ll pay his fare to wherever he wants to go.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are a softy! Pay a tramp’s fare?
Let me tell you, mister&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, going to hold this train all day?” demanded
the conductor bustling up. “What’s all
this?”</p>

<p>“This kid got on the train in the night some
place. Bin ridin’ the blind baggage. I was giving
him ‘what for’ when this other kid butts in,”
explained the brakeman.</p>

<p>“I said I was willing to pay this boy’s fare
rather than see him abused,” struck in Ralph,
flushing slightly.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s fair and square,” said the conductor,
“so long as he pays his fare, that’s all I
care. But I ain’t goin’ to hold my train. Where
d’ye want to go, boy?”</p>

<p>“This is Pine Pass, ain’t it?” demanded the
ride stealer, whom the brakeman had now released.</p>

<p>“This is the Pass,&mdash;yes. Come, hurry up.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ve come all the fur I’m goin’.”</p>

<p>As if to signify that his interest was over, the
conductor waved his hand to the engineers peering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
from their cabs ahead. The brakemen scampered
for their cars. The locomotives puffed and
snorted and the long train began to move. As
the conductor swung on he called back sarcastically:</p>

<p>“Sorry we couldn’t wait while you fixed it up.
Wish you joy of your bargain.”</p>

<p>In another instant the train was swinging
around into a long cut between deep, rocky walls.
In yet another instant it was gone, and Ralph
Stetson, with a rather puzzled expression on his
good-looking face, stood confronting the scarecrow-like
object he had rescued from the brakeman.
In the tenement-house district of any large
city the pitiful figure might not have looked out
of place.</p>

<p>But here, in the Canadian Rockies, with a boiling,
leaping torrent racing under a slender trestle,
great scraps of rocks and pine and balsam-clad
mountains towering above, and in the distance
the mighty peaks of the Selkirks looming against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the clean-swept blue, the spectacle that this waif
of the big towns presented seemed almost ludicrous
in its contrast. Ralph felt it so at least, for
he smiled a little as he looked at the disreputable
figure before him and asked:</p>

<p>“What are you doing at Pine Pass?”</p>

<p>The question was certainly a natural one. Besides
the tiny station, no human habitation was
in sight. Above it, threatening to crush it seemingly,
towered a precipice of dark colored rock.
Beyond this rose mighty pines, cliffs, waterfalls
and, finally, climbing fields of snow. Everywhere
peaks and summits loomed with a solitary
eagle wheeling far above. In the air was the
thunderous voice of the torrent as it tumbled
along under the spidery trestle beyond the station,
and the sweet, clean fragrance of the pines.</p>

<p>“What’m I doin’ at Pine Pass?” The ragged
youth repeated the question. “I-I’m sorry, mister,
but I can’t tell yer.” He paused, and a
strange, wistful look came into his eyes as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
gazed at the distant peaks, “I thought some time
I’d get up among them mountains; but there’s a
heap more of ’em than I calculated on.”</p>

<p>“How did you get here? Where did you come
from?” pursued Ralph.</p>

<p>“Frum Noo York.” And then, answering the
unspoken question, he continued, “You kin call
me Jimmie, and ef you want ter know how I got
yere, I jes’ beat it.”</p>

<p>“Beat it, eh? Tramped it, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yep. Stole rides when I could. Walked
when I couldn’t. Bin two munts er more, I
reckin. Steamboats, freights, blin’ baggage, anyting.”</p>

<p>“And what did you think you’d do when you
got here?”</p>

<p>“Work till I got some coin togedder. But it
don’t look much as if there was any jobs fer a
kid aroun’ here, does it?”</p>

<p>“It does not. What can you do?”</p>

<p>“Anyting; that’s on the level.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hum; you wait here a minute, Jimmie. I
don’t quite understand what brought you here,
and if you don’t want to tell me I won’t ask you.
But you wait here a minute and I’ll see what I
can do.”</p>

<p>“Say, you will? Kin you put me to woik?
Say, you’re all right, you are, mister. I’ll bet
you’d have put that braky away in a couple of
punches, big as he wuz.”</p>

<p>And the boy gazed admiringly after Ralph’s
athletic form as the latter hastened toward the
group at the end of the platform. They were
standing beside what appeared to be a small
mountain of baggage and they had just noticed
his absence.</p>

<p>“Well, what under the sun&mdash;&mdash;?” began Harry
Ware, whose full name, H. D. Ware, was, of
course, shortened at Stone fell College to Hardware.</p>

<p>“Simpering serpents, Ralph,” broke in Percy
Simmons, who, equally, of course, was known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
his boyish chums as Persimmons, “grinning gargoyles,
we knew this was to be a collecting trip,
but you appear to have started by acquiring a
scarecrow!”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, boys,” cried Ralph, half
laughingly, for Persimmons’ odd way of talking
and explosive exclamations made everyone who
knew him smile. “Hold on; listen to what happened.”</p>

<p>The eldest member of the group, a tall and
angular, but withal good-natured and kindly
looking man with a pair of shell-rimmed spectacles
perched across his bony nose, now
struck in.</p>

<p>“Yes, boys; let us hear what Ralph has been
up to now. I declare, since our experience along
the Border I’m prepared for anything.”</p>

<p>“Even what may befall us in the Canadian
Rockies, eh, Professor Wintergreen?” asked
Ralph. “Well, that lad yonder, if I’m not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
mistaken, is our future deputy cook, bottlewasher,
and midshipmate.”</p>

<p>They all stared at him. Persimmons was the
first to recover his voice.</p>

<p>“Giggling gophers,” he gasped, “as if Hardware
hadn’t brought along enough patent dingbats
without your adding a live one to the collection!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TORRENT.</p>

<p>Vacation time had rolled around once more at
Stonefell College, which accounts for our finding
Professor Wintergreen, Ralph Stetson, and the
latter’s chums at this isolated spot in the heart of
the Canadian Rockies. Readers of former volumes
of this series will at once recall the eccentric
professor and his young companion Ralph.
Harry Ware and Percy Simmons, however, we
have not met before. Jack Merrill and Walt
Phelps, the two young ranchmen who shared
Ralph’s adventure on the Mexican border, could
not be with him on the present vacation, both
boys being required at their western homes.</p>

<p>So it had come about that when Professor
Wintergreen received a commission to hunt specimens
in the Canadian Rockies, Ralph jumped at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the chance to accompany him. His father, the
railroad magnate, and Ralph’s mother had
planned a trip to Europe, but the boy, being
given the choice of the Rocky Mountain expedition
or the trip across the Atlantic, had, with
his characteristic love of adventure, chosen the
former without hesitation. His mother grieved
rather over this, but his father approved. “King-pin
Stetson,” as Wall Street knew the dignified
railroad magnate, approved of boys roughing it.
He had seen how much good Ralph’s western experiences
had done the boy. His shoulders had
broadened, his muscles hardened, and his eyes
grown brighter during his strenuous times along
the border. Not less noteworthy had been his
mental broadening. From an indolent attitude
toward studies, a condition caused, perhaps, by
his former rather delicate health, Ralph’s appetite
for learning had become as robust as the rest
of him.</p>

<p>There is no space here to detail all that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
happened during Ralph’s vacation on the Mexican
border. But briefly, as told in “The Border
Boys on the Trail,” it included the exciting experiences
attendant upon the capture of his
chums and himself by a border bandit, and their
sharing many perils and adventures on both
sides of the frontier. In the second volume,
called “The Border Boys Across the Frontier,”
the boys discovered the Haunted Mesa, and stumbled
by the merest accident upon a subterranean
river. The finding of this latter plunged them
into a series of accidents and thrilling adventures,
exciting beyond their wildest dreams. It is no
laughing matter to be captured and suspected as
spies by Mexican revolutionists, as the boys
found out. But they managed to stop the smuggling
of arms across the Border, as readers of
that volume know.</p>

<p>“The Border Boys with the Mexican Rangers”
showed how courage and skill may be more than
a match for villainy and duplicity. With the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“Rurales” the boys lived a life brimming to the
full with the sort of experiences they had grown
to love. The finding of a hidden mine, too, enriched
them all and gave each lad an independent
bank account of no mean dimension. The following
book, which was entitled “The Border
Boys with the Texas Rangers,” found the three
lads sharing the perils and hardships of the body
that has done so much to keep law and order in
a much vexed region. Brave, resourceful, and
skillful, as their former experiences had trained
them to be, the boys found full scope for all their
faculties with the Rangers. A band of cattle
thieves made trouble for them, and Jack Merrill’s
climb out of the Hidden Valley furnished
the most thrilling experience of his life.</p>

<p>Dearly would Ralph have loved to share with
his former companions the exciting times which
he was sure lay ahead of him in the Canadian
Rockies. But it was not to be, and so, when
young Ware and Percy Simmons both begged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
be “let off” from Bar Harbor and Newport, Professor
Wintergreen had, on their parents’ request,
decided to allow them to come along. The
professor’s interests in the Canadian Rockies
were purely scientific. His duty was to collect
specimens of minerals, and also of animal life,
for one of the best known scientific bodies in the
east. Ralph, with his knowledge of hunting and
woodcraft, was to be relied upon as a valuable
aide. Young Ware and Percy Simmons were
more or less Tenderfeet, though both had been
camping before.</p>

<p>When Ralph had finished relating Jimmie’s
story to the others, the professor said:</p>

<p>“I’ll talk to the lad myself. If he proves all
that he appears to be from your description,
Ralph, we might manage to use him. A boy willing
to make himself useful around camp might
come in handy.”</p>

<p>So the professor stalked off on his long legs
to interview Jimmie, who viewed his approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with awe, while the boys stood in a chattering
group about the pile of baggage. It was to be
remarked that most of it bore the initials H. D.
Ware, of which more anon.</p>

<p>“Wonder what’s become of that guide and the
ponies?” spoke up Ralph, while the Professor
interrogated the awe-struck Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” responded Hardware, gazing
at a dusty track that wound itself up the cliff back
of the station for a few yards, and was then lost
around a scrap of rock that glittered with “fool’s-gold.”
“Ought to be here by now, though.”</p>

<p>“Fiddling fish,” struck in Persimmons at this
moment, “there ought to be trout in that stream
below there, boys. I’m going down to have a
look.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll wait for you and give you
a hail when the ponies show up. Look out you
don’t fall in, though. Those rocks look slippery
where the water has dashed over them,” warned
Ralph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m all right,” responded Persimmons airily,
and he set out, clambering down the rocky path
leading to the brink of the foaming, brown torrent
that roared through Pine Pass.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, the Professor came back
with his arm on Jimmie’s shoulder. The man of
science, childlike in some things and absorbed
in study for the most part, was yet a fairly accurate
reader of human nature.</p>

<p>“I’ve been talking to Jimmie, boys,” he said, as
he approached, “and he’ll do. He’s been officially
engaged as general assistant to our guide with
the Wintergreen expedition.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Jimmie,” smiled Ralph, “and
so now your troubles are at an end for a time,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the waif filled with tears.</p>

<p>“I dunno jes how ter thank you, boss,” he said,
addressing all of them, “but I kin promise you
that I’ll make good.”</p>

<p>“Sure of that,” said the Professor kindly, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
I can’t make out why you won’t tell us what
brought you to such an out-of-the-way, not to
say remote, part of the world as this.”</p>

<p>“I’d tell yer if I could; honest I would, boss,”
spoke Jimmie; “but&mdash;but I can’t jes’ yet. Some
time maybe&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The lad broke off, and once more his wistful
eyes sought the distant peaks.</p>

<p>“Is them the Selkirks over yonder?” he asked
presently.</p>

<p>“Yes; those far peaks are,” said the Professor,
also gazing toward the giant ranges in the distance
whose crests glimmered with the cold gleam
of never-melting snow, “those are the Selkirks.”</p>

<p>“Goin’ that way?” asked Jimmie, his eyes still
riveted on the far-flung ranges.</p>

<p>“Yes; we hope to penetrate as far as that.
Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nuttin’. I hoped you was, that’s all.”</p>

<p>A smile played over Ralph’s lips. He was
about to ask Jimmie some bantering question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
about what he, the New York waif, expected to
find in the distant mountains, but at that instant
there came a piercing cry.</p>

<p>“Help! Guzzling grasshoppers! H-e-l-p!”</p>

<p>“Gracious! It’s Persimmons!” cried Ralph,
an alarmed look coming over his countenance.
Well did he know his friend’s capacity for getting
into trouble.</p>

<p>“Run, boys, run! He must be in a serious predicament!”
cried the Professor, as the cry came
once more.</p>

<p>At top speed they ran toward the end of the
platform and the rocky path leading to the thundering
mountain torrent.</p>

<p>“If he’s fallen in that creek, he’s a goner!”
shouted the station agent, rushing out of the
depot. “The falls are right below, and he’ll be
swept into them!”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">IN PERIL OF HIS LIFE.</p>


<p>Just how they clambered down that rocky, slippery
track none of the party was ever able to
recall in after life. But, burned deep on each
boy’s mind for as long as he should live was the
picture they saw as they came in full view of the
swirling, madly dashing torrent. Above a foam-flecked
eddy, beyond which the main current
boiled and seethed, towered the black, spider-like
outlines of the trestle. On the other shore was
a rocky steep covered with big pines and balsams.</p>

<p>Between the two, his white, frightened face
showing above the current as he clung with might
and main to a log, was Persimmons. This log,
evidently the trunk of a tree which had fallen
from its foothold beside the path on the depot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
side of the torrent, reached out some twenty feet
above the devil’s caldron of the stream. The
roots and the main part of the trunk rested on
the shore. That portion that projected over the
water was nothing more than a slender pole. The
freshets of spring had swept it clean of branch
or limb. It was as bare as a flag-staff.</p>

<p>Under it the green water rushed frantically on
toward a fall that lay beyond the trestle. The
voice of the cataract was plainly audible in their
ears, although in the extremity of their fear for
Persimmons they gave it no heed. It was almost
at the end of this frail support that the boy was
clinging. Only his head and shoulders were
above the water, which dragged malignantly at
him, trying to tear loose his hold. It was plain
at once that flesh and blood could not stand the
strain long. If they did not act to save him,
and that quickly, Percy Simmons was doomed
speedily to be swept from his hold and hurtled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the falls and&mdash;but they did not dare dwell upon
that thought.</p>

<p>How the boy could have got where he was, was
for the present a mystery. But there he was, almost
at the end of the slender tree trunk, which
whipped under the strain of his weight.</p>

<p>“Can you hold on?” shouted Ralph, using the
first words that came into his head.</p>

<p>They saw Persimmons’ lips move, but could
not hear his reply.</p>

<p>“Don’t make him speak; he needs every ounce
of breath he has,” said the professor, whose face
was ashen white under his tan. The boys were
hardly less pale. They looked about them despairingly.</p>

<p>“We must find a rope and get it out to him,”
cried Harry Ware.</p>

<p>“But how? Nobody could maintain a foothold
on that log,” declared Ralph.</p>

<p>“We might drift it down to him,” suggested
the station agent; “get on the bank further up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and allow the current to carry down a loop that
he could grab.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” cried the professor, hailing
any solution of their quandary with joy,
“have you got a rope?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the shack above. I’ll get it in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>Before he had finished speaking, the man was
off, racing up the rocky path as fast as his legs
could carry him.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Perce!” cried Ralph encouragingly,
waving his hand. “We’ll get you out of that in
no time.”</p>

<p>They saw poor Persimmons’ lips try to frame
a pitiful smile, but the next instant a wave of
foam dashed over him. After what seemed an
agony of waiting, but which was in reality only
a few minutes, the agent reappeared with several
yards of light but strong rope.</p>

<p>“Now we shan’t be long,” he said encouragingly,
as he rapidly formed a loop in it.</p>

<p>No sooner was this done, than Ralph seized the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
rope and tried to throw it over Persimmons’ head
like a lasso. He had learned to throw a rope like
a cowboy on the Border, but this time either the
feat was beyond his skill, or he was too unnerved
to do it properly. At any rate, at each attempt
the throw fell short, and the current whirled the
lifeline out of their comrade’s reach.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Persimmons had managed, by
this time, to brace his feet against an out-cropping
rock, and so give his overstrained arms some
relief. But it was obvious that, even with this
aid, he could not hold on much longer.</p>

<p>Nothing remained but to try the plan that the
agent had suggested, namely, to carry the rope
up the bank a little and try to drift it down
stream. With a prayer on his lips, Ralph made
the first cast. The rope fell on the water in what
appeared to be just the spot for the current to
carry it down to the boy they were trying to rescue.</p>

<p>But their joy was short lived. Having carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the loop a short way, a viciously swirling eddy
caught it and sucked it under the surface. It
became entangled in a rock, and they had much
ado to get it back ashore at all.</p>

<p>A sigh that was almost a groan broke from
Ralph as he saw the futility of his cast. It
looked like the last chance to save the boy whose
life depended on their reaching him quickly. It
was out of the question to get out on the slender,
swaying end of the trunk to which young Simmons
was clinging. Not one of them but was too
heavy to risk it. And, in the event of the trunk
snapping, they knew only too well what would
ensue. A brief struggle, and their comrade
would be swept to the falls, from which he could
not possibly emerge alive.</p>

<p>“We must save him!” panted Ralph, “but how&mdash;how?”</p>

<p>“The only way is to get the rope to him,” said
the professor.</p>

<p>“And we can’t accomplish that unless&mdash;I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
I can do it, professor,” broke off Ralph suddenly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean to do?”</p>

<p>“To straddle that log and get the rope out to
him in that way.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, it would not bear your weight even
if you could balance on it.”</p>

<p>But Ralph begged so hard to be allowed to put
his plan into execution that the professor was at
last forced to give way and consent to his trying
the perilous feat.</p>

<p>“But come back the instant you are convinced
you are in danger,” he commanded; “remember,
I am in charge of you boys.”</p>

<p>Ralph eagerly gave the required bond. Fastening
the rope to his waist, he straddled the narrow
trunk and gingerly began working himself forward
toward his imperiled chum.</p>

<p>He got along all right till he was in a position
where his feet began to be clawed at by the
hurrying waters below. He swayed, recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
himself by a desperate effort, and then once more
began his snail-like progress. The sight of Persimmons’
blue lips and white cheeks, for in that
land the waters are almost as cold in midsummer
as in the depth of winter, gave him fresh determination
to continue his hazardous mission.</p>

<p>But even the most determined will cannot always
overcome material obstacles. A chunk of
driftwood was swept against Ralph’s feet. He
was almost overbalanced by the force of the blow.
The watchers on shore saw him strive wildly for
an instant to recover his equilibrium, and then a
cry of alarm broke from their lips as they saw
the boy suddenly lose his balance completely and
topple off the trunk into the stream.</p>

<p>“The rope! Haul on the rope!” shouted the
professor, as Ralph vanished, to reappear an instant
later fighting for his life in the relentless
torrent.</p>

<p>Well it was for the boy then, that he had tied
the rope to his waist. Had he not done so, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
moment might have been his last, for even the
strongest swimmer that ever breasted water
would have been but a helpless infant in that
titanic current.</p>

<p>They all laid hold of the rope and pulled with
every ounce of muscle their combined forces
could command. But, even then, so strongly did
the swiftly dashing stream suck at its victim that
it was all they could do to get him ashore. Blue
and shivering from cold, however, Ralph finally
found footing and scrambled up the bank. Then,
and not till then&mdash;such had been the strain&mdash;did
they recollect Persimmons.</p>

<p>For an instant they hardly dared to look up.
They feared that the end of the long log might
prove to be tenantless. But, to their unspeakable
relief, Persimmons still was clinging there. But
even as they gave a shout of joy at the sight of
him, another thought rushed in. Of what avail
was it that the boy was there, when there appeared
no possible way of getting him out of his
predicament?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Were they to stand there helplessly and see
him swept to his death before their very eyes?
Was there nothing they could do? No untried
way of getting that precious rope to him?</p>

<p>It appeared that the answer to these questions
must be in the negative.</p>

<p>“Great heaven!” burst from the professor’s
pale lips, and his voice sounded harsh and rough
as if his throat was as dry as ashes. “Can’t we
do anything? Can none of you suggest a way?”</p>

<p>“I tink I can get dat rope out dere, if you’ll
gimme a chanct, boss,” piped a voice at his elbow.</p>

<p>They all looked around. It was Jimmie, whom,
in the stress of the last minutes, they had forgotten
as completely as if he had never existed. But
now here he was, repeating, with calm assurance,
but no braggadocio, his offer:</p>

<p>“I tink I can get it to him, if you’ll gimme a
chanct.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">JIMMIE’S PLUCK.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> can get that rope to him?”</p>

<p>The professor’s voice held a note of amazement
and possibly one of unconscious incredulity,
for Jimmie colored under his gaze.</p>

<p>“Sure I can.” He spoke rapidly, for it was
no time to waste words. “I used ter be wid a
circus for a time, see. I learned ter do a balancin’
act wid a troupe. I’ll jes’ take dat long
stick dere fer a balancin’ pole, and I’ll snake
him out fer youse, er&mdash;er I’ll go up de flume meself.”</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, there was something
in the manner of the waif that instilled a new
confidence into their hearts. Under other circumstances
they might not have felt it, but now,
with Persimmons’ life in such danger, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in the mood of drowning men who grasp at
straws.</p>

<p>Jimmie was such a straw, and his self-confident
manner formed to a not small degree the
basis of their trust in his ability to carry out
what he said he could accomplish. Carefully the
rope was transferred from the dripping, half-frozen
Ralph to Jimmie’s waist. This done, the
lad carefully balanced a longish branch he had
picked up, and appeared to find it suitable for use
as a balancing pole; for, after one or two trials,
he stepped out on the log and began such a “rope
walking” act as has seldom if ever been witnessed.</p>

<p>Before starting, he had kicked off his ragged,
broken boots,&mdash;stockings or socks he had none,&mdash;and
was now barefooted. The rough bark of
the tree trunk afforded a certain stability of footing,
but they held their breath as they watched
the waif’s slender, pitifully thin figure painfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
making its way on that narrow bridge above the
swirling, leaping waves of the torrent.</p>

<p>Once he hesitated and swayed, and a gasp went
up from the watchers on the bank. Involuntarily
they took a tighter grip on the rope. But it was
only the green rush of waters under his feet that
had momentarily caused Jimmie’s head to swim.</p>

<p>He swiftly recovered himself and, forcing his
eyes to remain riveted on a definite object, he
forged steadily ahead. Now he was only five
feet from where Persimmons, with a sub-conscious
strength, was hanging on to his precarious
hold, now but four feet intervened, then three,
two,&mdash;one! How the slender trunk swayed! It
appeared impossible that anything human could
keep its footing upon it.</p>

<p>But at last the young acrobat reached a point
beyond which he dared not go. Holding his balancing
pole with one hand, he undid the rope
from his waist with the other. Bending, very
slowly, very cautiously, he formed a loop and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
dropped it over Persimmons’ head. The numbed
boy had just strength enough to work it under
his armpits.</p>

<p>Then his strength gave out completely. He
would have been swirled away had not Jimmie
taken the precaution to pass the rope around the
opposite side of the tree trunk to that on which
the current was pulling. But Persimmons was
safe. The rope held him firm. He took a brief
interval for a breath, and then managed to work
his way along the trunk while the others hauled.</p>

<p>As for Jimmie, he crouched low for a time,
using his balancing pole with wonderful adroitness.
Then, walking backward along that swaying,
treacherous trunk, he reached shore just as
they dragged young Simmons out. It was in the
nick of time, too, for he could not have lasted
much longer. As it was, when they laid him on
the bank he collapsed utterly.</p>

<p>“Jimmie, if you ever were an acrobat, and
there’s no room to doubt that, you must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a marvel!” cried Ralph throwing his arms about
the boy’s neck, while the professor and Hardware
congratulated him hardly less enthusiastically,
and the agent danced a jig.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Jimmie, when he released
himself, “if you tink I was a wonder, ask Sig.
Montinelli, who trained me. I was so good dat
he used to beat the life out uv me. Dat’s de reason
I ran away frum de show and came up here,&mdash;dat
and annudder reason.”</p>

<p>There was no time just then to ask him what
he meant, for they were all immediately busied
in chafing poor Persimmons’ body and bringing
life back to him. The agent had rushed off up
the rocky path for hot coffee, for he had been
preparing his breakfast when the train came in.
What with this stimulant and a brisk rub-down,
Persimmons soon recovered and was able to sit
up and thank his rescuer, which he did characteristically
and warmly, despite the latter’s embarrassment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and frequent interruptions of “It
wasn’t nawthing.”</p>

<p>“Howling handsprings!” exclaimed Persimmons
to Ralph, as the latter helped him up the
rocky path, “and to think that I classed that kid
in with Hardware’s dingbats! But that’s what
he is, too,” he added with a sort of an inspiration;
“Hardware’s got his bags and boxes full of
fool fishing dingbats and cooking dingbats and
chopping dingbats, but this one of yours, Ralph,
is the greatest ever, he’s a life-saving dingbat.
What can I give him?”</p>

<p>“Not money, if you take my advice,” said
Ralph dryly. “While you were down and out
there the professor offered him some, and his
eyes blazed and he turned quite pale as he refused
it. ‘I’ve joined this expedition to be generally
useful, and that was only one of my jobs,
see,’ was what he said.”</p>

<p>“Waltzing wombats! I hope he never has to
be useful in just that way again,” breathed Persimmons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
fervently, as they reached the top of the
trail.</p>

<p>“I hope not. But how did you ever come to
get in such a fix?”</p>

<p>Persimmons explained that he had been looking
at some wonderful trout disporting themselves
in a pool some distance above where the
tree trunk stretched out over the waters of the
torrent. In some way his foot had slipped, and
before he knew what had happened he was
whirled out into midstream.</p>

<p>Hurried along, brushed by out-cropping rocks
and bits of drift timber, he had caught at the
first thing that offered, which happened to be the
trunk that so providentially stretched out above
the torrent.</p>

<p>“Bounding beetles! but it was a close shave,
I tell you,” he concluded fervently. “I don’t think
I could have held on a minute longer when Jimmie
got that rope to me; but when I felt it, new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
strength seemed to come to me and I could help
you fellows drag me ashore.”</p>

<p>For a consideration, the agent drew on his
stores, and they made a hearty breakfast after
this adventure. Jimmie, of course, was the hero
of the occasion, although no one could have accused
him of seeking honors. The boy looked
actually embarrassed as they each, in turn and in
chorus, told him over and over what they thought
of his plucky act.</p>

<p>They were still eating when there came a clatter
of hoofs on the cliff above.</p>

<p>“Something comin’ down the trail,” observed
the agent; “shouldn’t wonder if that’s your man
now.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, indeed,” said the professor, “this
delay is most annoying.”</p>

<p>Emerging from the depot they saw a strange
cavalcade coming down the dusty trail. In advance,
on a wiry buckskin cayuse, rode a figure
that might have stepped out of a book. His saddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was of the gaily rigged ranger’s type. But it
was the person who sat in it with an easy grace
that was more striking to the eye than any of
his caparisons.</p>

<p>He was of medium height, it appeared, but of
so powerful a build that his breadth of chest and
massive loins seemed better fitted for a giant.
His hair and beard were curly and as yellow as
corn silk, his face fiery red by constant exposure
to sun and wind and snow, while his eyes, deep-set
in wrinkles, were as blue as the Canadian sky
above them. His clothes were of the frontiersman’s
type, and on his massive head was a colorless
sombrero, badly crushed, with several holes
cut in its crown.</p>

<p>Behind him came, in single file, four wiry looking
little cayuses, saddled and bridled ready for
their riders. These were followed by three pack
animals of rather sorry appearance, but, as the
party was to learn later, of proved ability on the
trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“You Professor Summered?” he hailed, in a
deep, hearty voice, as he saw the professor and
the boys standing in a group outside the little
depot, eying him with deep interest and attention.</p>

<p>“Wintergreen, sir! Wintergreen!” exclaimed
the professor rather testily.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! ho! Beg your pardon. I’m Mountain
Jim Bothwell, at your service. Sorry to be
late, but the trail up above is none too good.”</p>

<p>He struck his pony with his spurs, and the
whole procession broke into an ambling trot coming
down the trail in a cloud of yellow dust toward
the waiting group of travelers.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE START FOR THE ROCKIES.</p>

<p>“Great Blue Bells of Scotland!”</p>

<p>Mountain Jim Bothwell uttered the exclamation
as he gazed at the immense pile of baggage
labeled H. D. Ware.</p>

<p>“Say, who <i>is</i> H. D. Ware, anyhow? He goin’
to start a hotel hereabouts? When’s the wagons
comin’ for all this truck?”</p>

<p>“That’s my camping equipment,” struck in
“H. D. Ware,” looking rather red and uncomfortable
under the appraising blue eye of Mountain
Jim.</p>

<p>“Young feller,” spoke Jim solemnly, “you’d
need an ocean liner to transport all that duffle.
We ain’t goin’ to sea; we’re goin’ inter the mountains.
What you got in there, anyhow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dingbats,” said Ralph quietly, a mischievous
smile playing about his mouth.</p>

<p>“Dingbats? Great Bells of Scotland, what’s
them?”</p>

<p>“The things that the sporting goods catalogues
say no camper should be without,” exclaimed
Ralph; “we told him, but it wasn’t any good.”</p>

<p>“Well, my mother said I was to have every
comfort,” said poor Hardware, crimsoning under
the guide’s amused scrutiny. “When we were
camping in Maine&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“When you were camping in Maine, I don’t
doubt you had a cook&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Hardware nodded. He had to admit that, like
most wealthy New Yorkers, his parents’ ideas of
“a camp” had been a sort of independent summer
hotel under canvas.</p>

<p>“Well, young fellow, let me tell you something.
From what the professor here wrote me, you
young fellers came up here to rough it. I’m goin’
to see that you do. The cooking will mostly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
done by you and your chums; your elders will&mdash;will
eat it, and that’ll be sufficient punishment for
them.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but I’ve just engaged a lad to aid with
the cooking and help out generally,” struck in the
professor.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” responded Mountain Jim
airily, eying Jimmie, whose clothes, since they
had been dried by the agent’s cook stove, looked
worse than before, “that kid seems all right, and
he can take his turn with the others. In the
mountains it’s share and share alike, you know,
and no favors. That’s the rule up this way.”</p>

<p>The boys looked rather dismayed. Already the
standards of the city were being swept aside.
Evidently this mountaineer looked upon all men
and boys as being alike, provided they did their
share of the work set before them.</p>

<p>Ralph, alone, whose wild life on the Border
had already done for him what the Rockies were
to perform for his companions, viewed the guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
with approval. He knew that out in the wilderness,
be it mountain or plain, certain false standards
of caste and station count for nothing. As
Coyote Pete had been wont to say in those old
days along the Border, “It ain’t the hide that
counts, it’s the man underneath it.”</p>

<p>“First thing to do is to sort out some of this
truck and see what you do need and what you
don’t,” decided Mountain Jim presently. “Most
times it’s the things that you think you kain’t get
along without that you kin, and the things you
think you kin that you kain’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ralph heartily. “Daniel
Boone, on his first journey into Kentucky,
managed to worry along on pinole and salt, and
relied for everything else on his old rifle and
flint and steel.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of the gentleman,” said Mountain
Jim, “but he must uv been a good woodsman.
Now let’s get to work and sort out this
truck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruthlessly the travelers’ kits were torn open,
and it was amazing, when Mountain Jim got
through, what a huge pile of things that he declared
unnecessary were heaped upon the depot
platform. As for poor Hardware’s “dingbats,”
a new kind of compass and a hunting knife that
met with Jim’s approval, alone remained.</p>

<p>“All this stuff can stay here till you get ready
to come back,” said Jim; “the station agent will
look after it and see that it is put in the freight
shed.”</p>

<p>But it is an ill wind that blows nobody any
good. Out of the rejected “Dingbats” a fine
hunting suit, axe, knife and compass were found
for Jimmie, who, indeed, stood sadly in need of
them. When the boy had retired to the station
agent’s room and dressed himself in his new
garments, the change in him was so remarkable,
when he reappeared, as to be nothing less than
striking. In the place of the ragged looking
Bowery boy, they saw a well set-up lad in natty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
hunting outfit. A trifle emaciated he was, to be
sure, but “We’ll soon fill him out with hard work
and good grub,” declared Mountain Jim, who
had been told the boy’s story, and who had
warmly praised his heroism in rescuing Persimmons.</p>

<p>The latter had also changed his wet garments
and was in his usual bubbling spirits when they
were ready, in Ralph’s phrase, to “hit the trail.”
This was not till nearly noon, however, for the
rejection of the superfluous “Dingbats,” of which
even Ralph and the professor were found to have
a few, had occupied much time. Then, after
hearty adieus to the station agent, who had incidentally
been the recipient of a generous gratuity
from the professor, they mounted their
ponies and, with Mountain Jim in the lead,
started on their long journey into the wilds.
Jimmy, whose circus experience had taught him
how to ride, was mounted on one of the pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
animals, for, such had been Mountain Jim’s ruthless
rejection of “Dingbats,” only a tithe of the
expected “pack” remained.</p>

<p>Up the trail they mounted at an easy pace under
the big pines that shook out honey-sweet
odors as the little cavalcade passed beneath them.
At the summit of the rocky cliff that towered
above the depot, the trail plunged abruptly into
a dense, black tunnel of tamarack, pine and
Douglas firs.</p>

<p>As the horses’ hoofs rang clear on the rocky
trail and echoed among the columnular trunks
that shot up on every side like the pillars of some
vast cathedral roof, Mountain Jim broke into
dolorous song:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Hokey pokey winky wang;</p>
<p class="pp6">Linkum, lankum muscodang;</p>
<p class="pp7">The Injuns swore that th-e-y would h-a-n-g</p>
<p class="pp6">Them that couldn’t keep w-a-r-m!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Over and over he sang it, while the shod hoofs
clattered out a metallic accompaniment to the
droning air.</p>

<p>“Can we ride ahead a bit?” asked Ralph after
a while, for the monotony of keeping pace with
the pack animals and the constant repetition of
Mountain Jim’s song began to grow wearisome.</p>

<p>“Sure; go ahead. You can’t get lost. The
trail runs straight ahead. The only way to get
off it is to fall off,” said Jim cheerfully, drawing
out and filling with black tobacco a villainous-looking
old pipe.</p>

<p>“Don’t get into any trouble,” warned the professor,
who had been provided with a quiet horse,
and who was intent, as he rode along, on a volume
dealing with the geological formation of the
Canadian Rockies.</p>

<p>“We’ll be careful! So long! Come on, boys,”
shouted back Ralph, as he struck his heels into
his pony.</p>

<p>Off they clattered up the trail, the rocks ringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
with their excited voices till the sound died
away in the distance. Jimmie alone remained behind.
He felt that his duty as general assistant
demanded it. When the last echo of the ponies’
hoofs had died out, Mountain Jim turned to the
professor with a profound wink.</p>

<p>“I can see where we have our hands full this
trip, professor,” he remarked, as they ambled
easily along.</p>

<p>The professor looked up from his book and
sighed.</p>

<p>“Really, I wonder my hair is not snow white,”
he said mildly. “But surely that is a fine specimen
of Aethusa Cijnapium I see yonder!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that,” said Mountain Jim, gazing at the
feathery plant indicated, which grew in great
profusion at the trail side, “that’s ‘fool’s
parsley.’”</p>

<p>“O-h-h!” said the professor.</p>

<p>He might have said more, but at that instant
from the trail ahead, came a series of shouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and yells that made it appear as if a troop of
rampant Indians was on the war-path. The
sharp crack of a rifle sounded, followed by
silence.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">ALONG THE TRAIL.</p>

<p>When they left the main body of the party
behind, Ralph, Harry Ware, and young Simmons
had kicked their ponies into a brisk “lope,” which
speedily carried them some distance ahead. As
they rode along, they gazed admiringly about
them at the beauties of the rugged trail. The
rough way soon left the tunnel-like formation of
spruce and tamarack, and emerged on a muskeg,
or patch of swampy ground, where rank, green
reeds and flowers of gorgeous red, yellow and
blue grew in the wetter places.</p>

<p>As they cantered into the midst of this pretty
bit of scenery, a striped animal sprang from behind
a patch of brush with a snort, and dashed
off into the timber on the hillside beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>With a whoop and yell the boys, headed by
Ralph, were after it.</p>

<p>“A wild cat!” shouted Ralph. “After him,
boys!”</p>

<p>Their lively little ponies appeared quite to
enter into the spirit of the chase. At any rate,
they needed no urging, but darted off as nimbly
as mountain goats among the trees. The gray
and reddish form of the wild cat was speedily
lost sight of; but Ralph, who had slipped his rifle
from its holster, still kept on under the shadows
of the forest, followed by the others.</p>

<p>Suddenly he thought he saw an elusive form
slipping among the timbers ahead of him. Flinging
the reins of his pony over the creature’s head,
in Western fashion, he dismounted. Hardware
and Persimmons followed his example. The eyes
of all three boys were shining with the excitement
of this, their first adventure in the Canadian
wilds.</p>

<p>“Cantering cayuses, boys, but we’ll have a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
skin to take home before we’ve been on the trail
ten minutes!” exclaimed Persimmons under his
breath, as they crept along behind Ralph.</p>

<p>“Don’t count your skins before you get ’em,”
was Hardware’s advice.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a sudden commotion
among the ponies. They snorted and sniffed as
if in terror of something, and Ralph rightly
guessed that they had just scented the wild cat.</p>

<p>“You fellows go back and quiet ’em; I’ll keep
on,” he said.</p>

<p>Dearly as his two companions would have liked
to continue on the trail of the wild cat, there was
nothing for them to do but to obey; for if the
ponies stampeded they knew that Mountain Jim
would have something to say that might not
sound pleasant.</p>

<p>“Be careful now, Ralph,” warned Hardware,
as their comrade kept on alone. “Wild cats are
pretty ugly customers sometimes.”</p>

<p>But Ralph did not reply. With a grim look on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his face and with his rifle clutched tightly, he
slipped from trunk to trunk, his feet hardly making
any noise on the soft woodland carpet of
pine needles.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from a patch of brush right ahead
of him, came a sort of yelping cry, not unlike
that of a dog in pain or excitement.</p>

<p>“What on earth is up now?” he wondered to
himself, coming to a halt and searching the scene
in front of him with eager eyes.</p>

<p>Then came sounds of a furious commotion.
The brush was agitated and there were noises as
if two animals were in mortal combat in front
of him. But still he could see nothing. All at
once came distinctly the crunching of bones.</p>

<p>“It’s that wild cat and she’s made a kill of
some sort, a rabbit probably,” mused Ralph.
“Well, I’ll catch her red-handed and revenge poor
Molly Cottontail.”</p>

<p>He cautiously tiptoed forward, making as little
noise as possible. He was well aware that a cornered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
wild cat can make a formidable opponent,
and he did not mean to risk wounding the animal
slightly and infuriating it. He was raising his
rifle with a view to having it ready the instant
he should sight the savage wood’s creature, when
he stepped on a dead branch.</p>

<p>It emitted a sharp crack, almost like a pistol
shot, and Ralph bit his lip with vexation.</p>

<p>“That cat’s going to run now, taking its prey
along, and I’ll not get within a mile of it,” was
his thought.</p>

<p>But no such thing happened. Instead, from
the bushes, there came an angry, snarling growl
as the crunching of bones abruptly ceased.
Ralph’s heart began to beat a little quicker. It
appeared that the cat, far from fleeing, was going
to show fight. But Ralph, after his first surprise,
did not worry: He knew his automatic would
be more than a match for the wild cat if it came
down to a fight.</p>

<p>With this thought in his mind he pressed boldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
forward, parting the bushes as he went. He
had not advanced more than a few yards when
he came upon a curious sight. A lithe, tawny
creature of reddish color, with oddly tufted ears,
was crouched over the dead and torn body of a
rabbit. It had been savagely rending the smaller
animal, and as Ralph took all this in he realized,
too, another fact. It was no wild cat that he
had disturbed, but another and a far more formidable
animal.</p>

<p>“Great juniper! A Canadian lynx, and a
whumper, too!” gasped the boy to himself as he
gazed at the creature which was almost as large
as a good sized dog.</p>

<p>For a moment the realization that he was face
to face with an animal that some hunters have
described as being more formidable than a mountain
lion, made Ralph pause, while his heart
thumped in lively fashion. The great yellow eyes
of the lynx, whose tufted ears lay flat against
its head, regarded him with blazing hatred. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
teeth were bared under its reddened fangs, and
Ralph saw that it was ready to spring at him.
It was only waiting to measure its distance accurately.</p>

<p>“I’ll give her all I’ve got in the gun,” thought
Ralph, bringing the weapon to bear; “my only
chance is to finish her quick.”</p>

<p>His finger pressed the trigger, but, to his
amazement, no report followed.</p>

<p>“Great guns! The mechanism has stuck and
I’ve not got an instant to fuss with it,” was the
thought that flashed through his mind as the rifle
failed to go off.</p>

<p>He had no time for more. With a growl and
snarl the tawny body was launched into the air,
as if propelled toward him by chilled steel springs.
Ralph gave a hasty, almost involuntary step
backward. His foot caught in an out-cropping
root and the next instant he measured his length
on the ground.</p>

<p>As he fell he was conscious of a flash passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
before his face and caught a glimpse of two yellow
eyes blazing with deadly hate and anger.
The next instant there was a crash in the brush
just beyond where he lay, and the boy realized
that his fall had been the luckiest thing in the
world for him. The lynx had overleaped him;
but he knew that the respite would not last the
fraction of a minute. He was in as great peril
as before unless he acted and that quickly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">TREED BY A LYNX.</p>

<p>There was but one thing to do and Ralph did it.
In the molecule of time granted to him, he got on
his feet. At the same time he uttered a yell
which had the intended effect of checking the
second onslaught of the lynx for an instant.</p>

<p>Of that instant Ralph took good advantage.
He bounded at full speed toward the nearest tree
which looked as if it might sustain his weight.
Luckily, there was one not far off&mdash;a dead cedar.
He managed to reach it just ahead of the lynx
and began scrambling into the low growing
branches. The rifle that had failed him in that
critical moment, he abandoned as useless; anyhow
he could not have climbed, encumbered with
the heavy weapon.</p>

<p>“If I ever get out of this I’ll stick to the old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
repeater,” was his thought as he flung
the weapon full at the head of the lynx, missing
her, in his agitation, by a good foot.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, Ralph had done what
he thought best in making for the tree. In
reality, though, had he had time for reflection,
he would better have taken his chances in a race
toward his companions, for of course a lynx can
climb as well as any wild cat. In fact, Ralph
had hardly gained a second’s security before the
creature flung herself furiously against the foot
of the tree and began climbing after the boy.</p>

<p>“She’s coming after me, sure as fate!” gasped
Ralph desperately. “Gracious, look at those
claws! I’ve got to stop her in some way; but
I’d like to know how.”</p>

<p>By this time he had clambered some distance
up the tree, an easy task, for the branches grew
fairly thick, and as the tree was dead there were
no leafy boughs to encumber his progress. But
unfortunately, this made it equally easy for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
assailant to pursue him. Ralph saw that unless
he did something decisive pretty quickly, he
would be driven to the upper part of the tree
where it would be unsafe for his weight.</p>

<p>Just above him, at this juncture, he spied a
fairly heavy branch which, it seemed, he might
break off easily. Reaching above him, the boy
gave it a stout tug, and found that he had at least
a good, thick club in his possession.</p>

<p>The lynx was just below him. Ralph raised
his luckily found weapon and brought it down
with a resounding crack on her skull.</p>

<p>With a howl of rage the creature dropped; but
caught on a lower branch and clinging there,
glared up at him more menacingly than before.
Far from injuring her as the boy had hoped, the
blow had only served to infuriate the creature.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as if determined to bring the contest
to a speedy termination, the lynx began
climbing again. Once more Ralph raised his club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and as the animal came within striking distance
he brought it down again with all his force.</p>

<p>“I hope I crack your ugly head,” he muttered
vindictively as he struck.</p>

<p>But by bad luck, Ralph’s hopes were doomed
to be blasted. He had struck a good, hard blow
and one that sent the lynx, snarling and spitting,
scurrying down the tree. But with such good
will had he delivered the blow that his club had
broken in two. The best part of it went crashing
to the ground, leaving him with only a stump
in his hand.</p>

<p>“If she comes back at me now, I’m done for,”
thought Ralph, as he looked downward.</p>

<p>But for the moment it appeared that the creature
had no such intention. Perhaps the two
blows had stunned and confused her. At any
rate she lay on one of the lower boughs seemingly
stupefied. As Ralph gingerly prepared to
descend, however, hoping to pass by the brute,
she gave a snarl and slipped with cat-like agility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to the ground. There, at the foot of the tree she
lay, gazing upward with malicious eyes. Evidently
she had given up her first method of attack,
but meant to lie there like a sentinel and
let Ralph make the next move.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” thought the boy as he saw this,
“I am in a fine pickle. I can’t fire any shots to
attract the attention of the bunch and I guess
shouting won’t do much good. They may come
to look for me, but they won’t know in what direction
to search.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ralph inhaled a good, deep
breath and shouted with all his lung power. But
no result was manifest, except that the lynx
growled and snarled and lashed its stumpy tail
angrily. Once it set up a dreary howl and the
unpleasant thought occurred to Ralph that the
creature might be calling its mate.</p>

<p>“If two of them come at me&mdash;” he thought;
but he didn’t dwell on that thought.</p>

<p>Instead, he cut himself another club and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sitting back, thought the situation over with all
his might. As if in search of an inspiration he
began rummaging his pockets. How he wished
he had brought his revolver along, or even the
ammonia “squirt-gun” that he carried occasionally
when traveling as a protection against ugly-natured
dogs. All at once, in an inside pocket,
his hand encountered a small bottle. Ralph almost
uttered a cry of joy. A sudden flash of
inspiration had come to him. In the bottle was
some concentrated ammonia. He had filled his
“squirt-gun” that morning before placing it in
the pack, and in the hurry of leaving the train at
Pine Pass had shoved the bottle into his pocket.</p>

<p>“It’s an awfully long chance,” he thought as
he drew out the bottle, “but, by Jove, I’ll try it.
Desperate situations call for desperate remedies,
and this is sure a tough predicament that I’m in.”</p>

<p>His movements had attracted the attention of
the lynx, and it reared up on its hind legs and
began clambering toward him once more. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
trembling fingers Ralph drew the cork of the
bottle, and a pungent odor filled the air. The
reek of the ardent drug made the boy’s eyes
water; but he was glad the stuff was so strong.
It suited his purpose all the better.</p>

<p>What he had to do now was nerve-racking in
the extreme. He did not dare to try to put his
plan into execution till the lynx got closer to him,
and to sit still and watch the ugly brute clambering
toward him was enough to upset the stoutest
nature. Ralph waited till the animal was on a
branch directly below him and was glaring up at
him as if making up its mind for the final onslaught.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he cried out:</p>

<p>“Take that, you brute!”</p>

<p>With a swift, sure aim he doused the contents
of the ammonia bottle full in the face of the lynx.
The effect was immediate and startling. With a
scream of rage and pain the blinded animal
dropped, clawing and scratching through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
dead limbs, to the ground. Landing on all fours
she began clawing up the earth in a frenzy of
pain. The sharp, pungent ammonia was eating
into her eyes like a red-hot flame.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above the yelps and howls of the
maddened creature, there came another sound, a
hail off in the woods.</p>

<p>“Ralph! oh, Ralph!”</p>

<p>“Here I am, fellows! This way! Come on
quick!” shouted Ralph at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>Then as they grew closer, still shouting, he
added a word of caution:</p>

<p>“Have your guns ready! I’m treed by a lynx!”</p>

<p>Through the trees the two boys burst into
view. At the same instant the lynx dashed madly
off toward the trail. As she dashed along she
pawed her tingling eyes, trying in vain to rid
them of the smarting fluid that Ralph’s lucky
throw had filled them with.</p>

<p>Ralph slid to the ground and picking up his
faithless rifle joined his chums in a wild chase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
after the animal. Yelling like Comanches they
dashed after, making the uproar that had
alarmed and startled the professor and Mountain
Jim and their young companion. But it was not
till they reached the trail, beyond the now tethered
horses, that they came within shooting distance
of it. Then Persimmons raised his rifle
and fired.</p>

<p>As the shot echoed across the muskeg the lynx
bounded into the air, turned a somersault, and
just as the rest of the party rode up, lay twitching
in death with Persimmons bending proudly
over it.</p>

<p>“Larruping lynxes,” he was shouting, “I guess
we’ve got at least one skin to take home!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">A WALKING PINCUSHION.</p>

<p>Ralph’s story was soon told, with the accompaniment
of a running fire of sarcasms from
Mountain Jim concerning automatic rifles and all
connected with them. An examination of Ralph’s
weapon showed that a cartridge from the magazine
had become jammed just at the critical instant
that he faced the lynx.</p>

<p>“There ain’t nuthin’ better than this old Winchester
of mine,” declared Mountain Jim, taking
his well-oiled and polished, albeit ancient
model rifle from its holster and patting it lovingly.
“I’ve carried it through the Rockies for
fifteen years and it’s never failed me yet.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the boys did not condemn their
automatics on that account. In fact, Ralph
blamed his own ignorance of the action of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
new weapon more for its failure to work than
any fault lying with the rifle itself.</p>

<p>With a few quick strokes of his knife and a
tug at the hide, Mountain Jim had the lynx
skinned with almost incredible rapidity. Salt
was sprinkled liberally on the skin, and it was
rolled up and tied behind Persimmons’ saddle, to
be carefully scraped of all fat and skin later on.</p>

<p>It was sunset when they left the well-traveled
trail, along which, however, they had encountered
no human being but a wandering packer
on his way to an extension of the Canadian Pacific
Railroad with provisions and blasting powder,
borne by his sure-footed animals.</p>

<p>In the brief twilight they pushed on till they
reached a spot that appeared favorable for a
camp. A spring gushed from a wall of rock and
formed one of an almost innumerable number of
small streams that fed a creek, which, in turn,
was later to pour its waters into the mighty Columbia.
Ralph needed no instructions on how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to turn the horses out, and while he and the rest,
acting under his directions, attended to this,
Mountain Jim got supper ready. By the time
the boys had completed their “chores” and the
tents were up, the guide had their evening meal
of bannocks, beans and bacon, and boiling hot
tea ready for them. For dessert they had stewed
dried prunes and apples, and the boys voted the
meal an excellent one. Indeed, they had been
hungry enough to eat almost anything.</p>

<p>Supper despatched, it was not long before they
were ready to turn into their blankets, which were
of the heavy army type, for the nights in the
Rockies are cool. To the music of a near-by
waterfall, they sank into profound slumber, and
before the moon was up the camp was wrapped
in silence.</p>

<p>It was about midnight that they were aroused
by a loud wail of distress from the tent which
Persimmons shared with his two chums. Mountain
Jim rolled out of his blankets&mdash;he disdained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
tents&mdash;and Jimmie, who likewise was content
with a makeshift by the fire, started up as
quickly. From the door of the professor’s tent
appeared an odd-looking figure in striped pajamas.</p>

<p>“Great Blue Bells of Scotland! What’s up?”
roared Mountain Jim.</p>

<p>“Wow! Ouch! He’s sticking me! Ow-w-w-w!”
came in a series of yells from Persimmons.
“Ouch! Prancing pincushions, come quick!”</p>

<p>“Is that boy in trouble again?” demanded the
professor, as he slipped on a pair of slippers and
advanced with Mountain Jim toward the scene
of the disturbance. The air was now filled with
boyish shouts, echoing and re-echoing among
the craggy hills that surrounded the small canyon
in which the camp was pitched.</p>

<p>As they neared the tent, from under the sod-cloth
a small dark form came shuffling forth. It
grunted as it went, like a diminutive pig. Jim
jerked his old Winchester to his shoulder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the death struggle of the small animal immediately
followed the rifle’s report.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the three boys clad in their
underclothing, dashed out of the tent door.</p>

<p>“Is it Indians?” shouted Hardware.</p>

<p>“A bear?” yelled Ralph, who had his automatic
in hand.</p>

<p>“More like a walking pincushion,” yelled Persimmons,
dancing about and nursing one of his
hands, “look here!”</p>

<p>He held out his hand and they saw several objects
which, in the moonlight, looked like so many
knitting needles projecting from it.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Mountain Jim, whose
mirth aroused Persimmons’ secret indignation,
“I reckon it was a walking pincushion, all right.
Boy, don’t never put your hand on a porcupine
again, they always leave souvenirs.”</p>

<p>“A porcupine!” cried the professor.</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” rejoined the guide, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
rolled to their feet with his rifle barrel the body
of the small animal he had shot.</p>

<p>It was surely enough one of those spiny and
familiar denizens of the north woods.</p>

<p>“Nodding needles! No wonder I felt as if I’d
struck a pincushion,” cried poor Persimmons,
who had, by this, drawn the last of the offending
quills from his hand. “I heard something grunting
and nosing about my blankets, and when I
put my hand out I got it full of stickers.”</p>

<p>“I’ll put some peroxide on,” said the professor,
hastening to his tent for the medicine chest.</p>

<p>“They aren’t poisonous, are they?” asked
Ralph, referring to the quills.</p>

<p>“No; just sharp, that’s all,” responded Mountain
Jim. “Porcupines are the greediest and
stupidest cusses in the woods. I reckon this one
smelled grub and was investigating when he ran
into Master Simmons here.”</p>

<p>“You mean that Persimmons ran into him,”
corrected Ralph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guggling geese, no!” expostulated Persimmons,
holding out his hand to be dressed, for the
wounds made by the sharp quills were bleeding,
“he ran into me, don’t ever mistake that.”</p>

<p>It was some time before the camp quieted down
again, but finally peace was restored and a tranquil
night, undisturbed by any more nocturnal
adventures, was passed.</p>

<p>Bright and early the next day they set out once
more, traveling now off the beaten track and
making for their destination, the Big Bend of the
Columbia River. The professor was on the lookout
for what he called metamorphic specimens of
rock, which, in plain English, means bits of
stone and so forth that show traces of the new
world in the making. For, as he had explained
to the boys, the Canadian Rockies are, from a
geologist’s standpoint, of recent formation. Unlike
many chains of like character, they are not
supposed to be volcanic in formation. The final
cause of the uplifting of their giant crests is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
generally attributed to the shrinkage of the
earth’s interior by loss of heat or some other action.
It is also supposed that eons ago the
Rockies were as lofty as the Himalayas or the
Andes, but that the various destructive forces
that worked and still work amidst their rugged
bosoms, have diminished their stature by thousands
of feet.</p>

<p>It was at the close of their second day’s travel
that the first of a series of mysterious happenings,
destined to puzzle them greatly in the future,
occurred. Ralph, who had been disturbed
by the noise of some nocturnal animal trampling
about in the brush, rose from his blankets and
emerged into the moonlight with his rifle, his
thoughts centered on the notion that his long-cherished
hope of shooting a grizzly had materialized.</p>

<p>Not far from the camp, and overlooking it, a
lofty rock towered above the floor of the valley
through which they were then traveling. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
moonlight its dark form was silhouetted blackly
against the night sky. Ralph’s heart gave a leap
as he saw, or thought he saw, something moving
on the summit of the great boulder.</p>

<p>He raised his rifle to fire and stood with beating
pulses awaiting the opportunity.</p>

<p>Suddenly a form moved into view on the summit
of the rock. The boy’s finger was just about
to press the trigger, when he gave a gasp of astonishment
and the rifle almost fell from his
hands.</p>

<p>It was the form of a man that had appeared,
blackly outlined against the moonlight. For one
instant the figure stood there and then, as Ralph
hailed it in a quavering voice, it wheeled, and like
an alarmed wild beast, slipped off into the forest.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">A MOUNTAIN MYSTERY.</p>

<p>Ralph said nothing of his adventure of the
night till the next morning. As he had expected,
his young chums put it down to a feverish imagination.
Even the professor suggested a dose of
quinine; but Mountain Jim walked over after the
morning meal to where the boy had seen the apparition,
which, Ralph was beginning to believe,
the figure must have been.</p>

<p>The lad accompanied the mountaineer, who
had expected to find some tracks or traces by
which Ralph’s adventure might be verified. But
the ground was rocky, and the soft bed of the forest
beyond held no tracks, so that they were disappointed
in their anticipation of finding some
clew to the strange appearance of the night.</p>

<p>“You’re certain sure, dead certain sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
you did see something. Didn’t just dream it?”
questioned Mountain Jim as they made their way
back to camp where the others were busy packing
the ponies, even Persimmons being by this
time able to cast a “diamond hitch.”</p>

<p>“I’m positive,” declared Ralph firmly; “if I
hadn’t been so certain that what I saw was a
man, I would have fired. But who could it have
been?” he added in a perplexed voice. Jim shook
his blond head.</p>

<p>“Great Blue Bells of Scotland, I dunno, boy,”
he said, thoughtfully puffing at his pipe. “You
ain’t the sort of lad to dream things, I can see
that. But it’s got me. If we’d been in the gold
country now it might have been a prospector, but
nobody goes through here, not even hunters, for
right where we are now is a bad place for game.”</p>

<p>So, for the time being, the mystery of the midnight
visitor was unsolved and almost forgotten.
It was destined to be recalled later in a startling
manner, but for the present even Ralph began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
believe that he might have been the victim of
some sort of an hallucination, caused, possibly,
by the fact that he was only half awake when
he had beheld the figure on the rock.</p>

<p>As Mountain Jim had said, the country
through which they were now traveling was indeed
a bad section for hunters. Although the
boys made several detours after game, not so
much as a rabbit did they see. The day following
the night on which Ralph had seen, or
thought he had seen, the figure of the watching
man, they encountered, for the first time, a tract
of country common enough in the Canadian wilds
but particularly unpleasant to travel through,
namely, a <i>brulee</i> or vast tract of woods through
which a forest fire has swept, leaving desolation
in its path.</p>

<p>Nothing more depressing can be imagined than
these burned forests. Naked, blackened trees,
with rags of scorched bark peeling from their
bare trunks, tower out of a desert expanse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
gray-black ash. Horses or foot travelers passing
through, churn up clouds of this ashen dust
which chokes the nostrils, burns the eyes and
blackens everything with which it comes in contact.</p>

<p>Our travelers found themselves on the outskirts
of such a place some time before noon on
the day mentioned. Mountain Jim had at first
thought of making a detour up a mountain side,
but after a consultation it was decided to press
on through the desolate waste, where charred
trunks stuck up like the blackened stumps of
teeth in an old man’s jaws.</p>

<p>As they plunged into the <i>brulee</i> they found
their ponies sinking over the fetlocks in the ashes.
In places, huge piles of trunks, burned through
at the base, lay like barriers across their path,
and it was necessary to go around them to find a
passable way. Long before they were out of the
wretched place the water in their canteens was
gone, and their throats were clogged and lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
cracked from the dry, acrid dust that rose in
clouds. From time to time the boys were compelled
to rub their eyes to relieve the tingling
smart in them, and speedily their faces were
blackened like those of coal heavers. A more
sorry-looking party it would be hard to imagine
than that which, hour after hour, painfully wended
its way through the burned forest. Not a
sprig of green, not a rill of water refreshed their
sight. No birds or animals could be seen or
heard. On every side was nothing but black
desolation.</p>

<p>Ralph and young Ware rode ahead, side by
side, while behind straggled the rest of the party.
Mountain Jim brought up the rear behind the
pack animals, which needed urging with whip
and voice through the desolation of the <i>brulee</i>.
Now and then, far off, they could hear the crash
of some forest giant as its burned-through trunk
gave way and it came smashing to the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
with a roar like thunder, not infrequently bringing
two or three of its mates with it.</p>

<p>Jim had warned the boys and the professor
to be on the lookout for such things, and as Ralph
and Harry Ware rode along they kept a bright
and vigilant watch for any tree that looked as if
its fall was imminent.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! I feel like an ant that has lost its
way in the ashes of a camper’s fire,” was the
graphic way in which Hardware expressed his
feelings, as for the twentieth time that morning
he tried to clear his throat of ashes.</p>

<p>They ate a hasty lunch, of which, the boys declared,
ashes formed the chief ingredient, for the
dry, implacable gray dust appeared to sift into
every mouthful they tasted. A long stop was out
of the question. There was no knowing how far
the <i>brulee</i> extended and they must push on and
get to water, for already the ponies were beginning
to show signs of distress. The poor animals’
sweaty sides were caked with gray dust till they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
all appeared of one uniform drab color. For the
matter of that, the travelers themselves were no
better off. Like a dull monochrome, they were
cloaked in ashen gray from head to foot.</p>

<p>Hardly speaking, for their spirits were at the
lowest ebb in this ghastly ruin of a majestic forest,
they pushed on. The only life in the <i>brulee</i>
appeared to be the black flies and mosquitoes
which bit till they drew blood, further annoying
them.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d rough it in the West,” muttered
Ralph once as his pony tumbled over a
blackened trunk that lay across the trail, “but
this beats anything I’ve ever experienced,&mdash;pah!”
and he spat out a mouthful of ashy dust.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on, and still they stumbled
along through the <i>brulee</i> without any signs of its
coming to an end. As far as they could see the
forest of blackened trunks extended, the same
carpet of ashen dust was everywhere. The sun,
growing lower, hung like a glowing ball of copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
in a red sky, seen through the dust that they
kicked up as they moved painfully along.</p>

<p>The horses were driven half mad by the biting
flies, and their fetlocks were cruelly bruised
and cut by the charred logs and rocks. It was
heartbreaking traveling, but of a kind that must
befall sooner or later everyone who ventures
into the wilds of the Canadian Rockies.</p>

<p>Tired, choked and irritable, Harry Ware was
lagging behind Ralph, who was now riding in advance
alone. Behind him he could hear the voice
of Mountain Jim unceasingly urging on the pack
animals. Mountain Jim never swore, but his
range of words which were forceful and expressive
without being profane, was amazing. Evidently,
too, his adjurations had their effect on the
jaded ponies, for they stumbled bravely on leaping
logs and dodging stones with renewed agility
every time the guide’s voice boomed through that
blackened, fire-swept wilderness.</p>

<p>Ralph had fallen into a semi-doze. The deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
monotony of the half-calcined columns on
every hand, the close heat of the <i>brulee</i> made him
drowsy. The voice of Mountain Jim fell more
and more faintly on his ears. Harry Ware, kicking
his pony viciously, passed him.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be the first out of this beastly
place,” he remarked with emphasis as he rode by.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t kick any more dust in my face
than you can help,” rejoined Ralph, only a shade
less irritably.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” snapped Harry, ordinarily the
best and most even-tempered of boys.</p>

<p>Ralph flushed angrily for an instant and his
hand clenched as a cloud of choking dust was
spurned in his face by the heels of Harry Ware’s
mount. But the next instant he gained control
of himself.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! I guess we’re all losing our tempers,”
he murmured to himself, “and it’s a fact that
this place would make a saint cross&mdash;Hold up
there, pony! Not much longer now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Content with his spurt ahead, Hardware slowed
his pony down to a walk a few paces in front
of Ralph. He did not apologize for his unthinking
act of smothering Ralph with dust. Instead,
he gazed sullenly straight ahead of him.</p>

<p>He was hot, thirsty, and bitten mercilessly by
black flies. The lad was in no mood to go around
obstacles. Rather was he in that savage humor
that rushes recklessly on, although he had been
warned of the dangers of the <i>brulee</i>. In fact, the
frequent crashing of half burned-through trees,
as a vagrant wind caught them and snapped them
off, would have been sufficient indication that a
sharp lookout was necessary to anyone in a less
irritable mood. But Harry didn’t think of this.
Instead, he urged his tired pony viciously over
blackened logs with quirt and heel.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ralph, whose vigilance had not relaxed
although he was fearfully drowsy, thought
he saw a great blackened trunk directly ahead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
them lean over a trifle. He was sure of it in another
moment.</p>

<p>“Pull out!” he yelled to Harry, who was driving
his pony straight in a path which would
bring him under the swaying trunk.</p>

<p>“Oh, mind your own business!” flung back
Hardware crossly, and drove his little mount
right on.</p>

<p>Ralph did not hesitate a minute. He wore
spurs, the same blunt-rowelled pair he had used
on the border. He drove these into his pony’s
side and brought down his quirt with a crack
that made the little animal snort angrily and
plunge forward.</p>

<p>In front of him he saw the mighty column
sway and oscillate as though in a vain attempt to
recover its equipoise. Directly under it was Harry
Ware, sullenly riding on with his eyes on the
ground. Once more Ralph yelled and his pony
gave a wild leap forward.</p>

<p>Suddenly the mighty trunk rushed earthward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Simultaneously Ralph’s hand fell on Hardware’s
bridle. He gave a tug that brought the latter’s
pony up on its haunches. It reared wildly, almost
toppling backward.</p>

<p>At the same instant a cold wind fanned both
boys as the trunk swept down. There was a
deafening crash almost under the feet of the
plunging ponies, and both lads were shrouded
in a cloud of black dust that rose up like a dark
veil.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! They’re killed!” shouted the
professor dashing forward.</p>

<p>About the two boys the dust whirled and eddied.
The ponies plunged wildly, almost unseating
them, but Ralph held on till he had dragged
Hardware’s mount out of the black dust cloud.</p>

<p>As he did so, from ahead of them, came crash
after crash with a startling suddenness. The
<i>brulee</i> was filled with shocks of sound that rang
in thunderous reverberations along the steep
rocks. The echoes flung back and forth till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
uproar was deafening. In the meantime the party,
including the two lads who had been saved
from what appeared certain death, stood fast.</p>

<p>They hardly breathed till the crashes grew less
and less frequent and a brooding silence settled
down over the <i>brulee</i> once more.</p>

<p>Then Hardware, shaking all over, gazed at the
great trunk lying recumbent not two yards from
them. His eyes filled with tears. He held out a
blackened hand to Ralph, who smiled at him
through his mask of gray ash.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;I don’t know how to thank you, Ralph,
old man,” he choked out. “If it hadn’t been for
you, in my silly temper I’d have gone right on
without minding you, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He could not go further, but Ralph’s fingers
closed on his out-stretched hand.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, old man,” was all he said;
but between both boys a thrill ran as their fingers
clasped. Hardware had learned a lesson
there in the <i>brulee</i> that all the schools in Christendom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
couldn’t have taught him, and he knew it.</p>

<p>“A mighty near thing,” said Mountain Jim, as
the others rode up, “I guess I’ll have a smoke.”</p>

<p>His voice was steady enough, but his hands
shook as he filled his old brier. Death had swept
by too closely for any of them to recover their
nerve for half an hour or more. By that time,
as they rode on, the charred trunks were fewer
and fewer, and an hour before sundown they
came out of that “Valley of Desolation” into a
wide canon, carpeted with lush, green grass and
watered by a crystal clear stream. On each side
towered rocky scraps of cliff clothed with dark
pines and balsams.</p>

<p>Boys and men broke into a cheer, and even the
dispirited ponies fell into a brisk gait without
urging. The travelers forgot their trials as they
laved in the fresh, cold water of the mountain
stream and watched Jim getting supper, assisted
by Jimmie, while the ponies ravenously cropped
the fresh, juicy grass. But it was days before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the last trace of ashes was removed from their
belongings, and one at least of the party was destined
never to forget that <i>brulee</i> in the Rockies as
long as he might live.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE PONIES VANISH.</p>

<p>Ralph’s first act on wakening the next morning
was to pull open the flap of the tent and gaze
out. His next was to utter a shout of surprise.
Of the ponies which had been turned out to graze
the evening before, not a sign was to be seen.
As usual, they had been driven out with old Baldy,
the leader of the pack horses, as the “bell”
pony. Like most ponies in the wilds, they had
hitherto stuck closely to Baldy who, for his part,
was usually quite content to remain around camp
so long as the grazing was good.</p>

<p>But although Ralph listened closely, he could
not catch even the familiar tinkle of the bell that
would have told him that Baldy and the rest were
somewhere near at hand.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a nice pickle,” he thought, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
set off to stir Jim into wakefulness, “it means a
day’s delay while we hunt for the ponies; however,
there appears to be plenty of rock in this
vicinity for the professor to explore and hammer
away at, so I suppose he’ll be happy.”</p>

<p>Jim greeted Ralph’s news without much surprise.
It appeared that in years of packing he
had grown used to such eccentricities on the part
of ponies.</p>

<p>“We’ll track ’em down after breakfast,” he
said, rolling out of his blanket and pulling on his
boots.</p>

<p>In the meantime Ralph had aroused the others,
and they set off for a cool plunge in the
stream. The water was icy and made them
gasp, but they felt a hundred per cent. better
after their bath. As Persimmons put it, “They
began to feel as if the world was made of something
else than ashes.” While the professor
made less strenuous ablutions, the boys rubbed
each other into a warm glow and then indulged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in a merry game of tag on the springy turf, and
yet they were ready to respond eagerly to Jim’s
breakfast call of:&mdash;“Come and get it!” accompanied
by a vigorous solo on the wash tin performed
by Jimmie.</p>

<p>It was wonderful what a difference there was
in the New York waif already. The crisp mountain
air had reddened his pale cheeks and the
rough but plentiful “grub” had had its effect in
nourishing his skinny frame. The old wistful
look still lurked in his eyes, and all the boys’ attempts
to drag from him the reason for his desire
to penetrate the Rockies were in vain. So,
perforce, they had to allow it to remain a mystery
till such time as the lad himself chose to
enlighten them. Bits of his history he had already
imparted to them. The lad had enlivened
many a camp fire with stories of his experiences
in the saw-dust ring, and in selling papers in
New York. Besides this, he had worked at peddling
soap powder and household goods, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
had some amusing narratives of his experiences
among the farmers of the Catskills where he had
worked as an “agent.” And as he lived with the
boys, he adopted their language and ways as
though he had been born to them.</p>

<p>“There’s a treat for you fellows this morning,”
said Jimmie with a mysterious air, as the hungry
boys squatted down and prepared to pass up
their tin plates for their shares of bacon, bannocks
and beans.</p>

<p>“What may that be, Jimmie?” inquired Ralph,
while Mountain Jim grinned expansively.</p>

<p>Persimmons sniffed the air anticipatively.</p>

<p>“Seems to me I do smell something good,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“How would pancakes go?” inquired Jimmie.</p>

<p>“Great! Jimmie, you ought to be in Delmonico’s,”
cried Hardware hungrily.</p>

<p>“I’ve been on the outside lookin’ in, many a
time,” said Jimmie with a grin, as he turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the “spider” and began dishing up the thin, brown
batter cakes.</p>

<p>Mountain Jim was on hand with a tin of maple
syrup fashioned like a miniature log-cabin,
the chimney forming the spout.</p>

<p>“Eat hearty, boys,” he said, as he passed it
along, “and try to forget the black flies for a
while.”</p>

<p>Early as the hour was, those pests were already
at work, in spite of the “smudge” that
Mountain Jim had built.</p>

<p>“Wish I’d put some of that black-fly dope on
my hands,” muttered Hardware, “it’s great
stuff.”</p>

<p>“Even if it does smell like cold storage eggs
with the lid off,” laughed Ralph.</p>

<p>As he spoke he poured a liberal amount of
syrup on his cakes. With hearty appetite he cut
off a big slice of the top cake and eagerly took it
into his mouth. For an instant a puzzled expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
played over his features, and then he gave
a yell.</p>

<p>“Wow! Oh!” he ejaculated, and bolted from
the “table.”</p>

<p>“What’s up? What’s the trouble?” asked the
others.</p>

<p>“Been bit by a snake?” asked Mountain Jim
apprehensively. “Better get out your medicine
chest, professor.”</p>

<p>Ralph was frantically gulping down several
dipperfuls of water from the bucket Jimmie had
brought from the creek. They watched him with
some alarm, holding bits of pancake suspended
on their forks.</p>

<p>“Oh-h-h-h!” sputtered Ralph, and then turned
to Jimmie, who stood looking on with undisguised
amazement.</p>

<p>“Say, you,” he gasped out, “did you put any
of that fly dope on your hands this morning?”</p>

<p>“Y-y-y-yes,” stammered Jimmie, a guilty flush
spreading over his face, “I did and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you forgot to wash it off before you mixed
the batter for these cakes,” sputtered Ralph.
“Fellows, pancakes flavored with fly dope are the
worst ever.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” grunted Hardware, “and I was
counting on pancakes!”</p>

<p>“Dancing dish rags!” growled Persimmons.
“What sort of a cook are you anyhow, Jimmie?
Flavored with fly dope,&mdash;wow! wow!”</p>

<p>Jimmie looked ready to cry, and sniffed his fingers
remorsefully.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” he admitted dolefully.
“I’m sorry, fellows, but I reckon as a cook I’m a
failure.”</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t poison, that’s all,” groaned
Hardware, with a glance at Ralph. “Feel any
symptoms, Ralph?”</p>

<p>“None that can’t be stopped by plenty of coffee
and a big plateful of grub,” laughed Ralph
good-naturedly.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">RALPH’S VOLCANO.</p>

<p>Mountain Jim’s examination of the trails left
by the errant ponies showed that they had scattered
in three distinct directions. This confirmed
him, he said, in a belief he had previously
formed that the animals had been frightened during
the night by a bear or mountain lion, the latter
called, in that part of the country, a cougar.</p>

<p>No tracks of either wild beast was to be seen,
but that by no means proved that they had not
been in the vicinity. Horses can scent either a
cougar or a bear at a considerable distance when
the wind is toward them, and there are few things
that more terrify a pony than the near presence
of one of these denizens of the northern wilds.</p>

<p>Jim assigned himself to one trail, Persimmons
and Hardware to another and Ralph to a third.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
The professor and Jimmie were to remain in
camp and wash dishes and set things to rights,
and then Jimmie was to assist the professor in
gathering specimens of rock from the cliffs in
the vicinity.</p>

<p>It was odd to see how, in an emergency, a
man like Mountain Jim, who probably had little
more scholarship than would suffice to write his
own name, took absolute leadership over the
party. The professor, whose name was known
to a score of scientific bodies all over the country
as a savant of unusual attainments, obeyed the
son of the Rockies implicitly. Such men as Jim
are natural leaders, and in situations that call for
action automatically assume the supremacy over
men of theory and book learning.</p>

<p>Jim explained his reason for assigning Ralph
to follow a lone trail while the other two lads had
been ordered to accompany each other. Ralph
had plainly shown his skill as a ranger and had
the experience of his life on the Border behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
him. The other two, while self-reliant and
plucky, had not had the same experience, and
therefore the guide deemed it best not to send
either out alone.</p>

<p>With hearty “So-longs” the three searching
parties set out, striking off in a different direction
up the mountain side. It was rough country,
with beetling masses of gray rock cropping
out now and then amidst the somber green of the
Douglas firs and great pines. Here and there
cliffs of great height and as smooth as the side
of a wall, towered sharply above the forest, and
beyond lay a “hog-back” ridge of considerable
height. Beyond this, although they could not see
them from the valley, the boys knew that mountain
range after mountain range was piled up like
the billows of an angry sea, with the higher
peaks of the Rockies raising their crests like
snow-crowned monarchs beyond and above all.</p>

<p>Each boy carried a canteen of water, his rifle,
and a supply of bread and chocolates. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they also carried their small axes, slung in canvas
cases at their belts, and matches in waterproof
boxes. These same waterproof match
safes were, in fact, among the few “Dingbats”
approved by Mountain Jim.</p>

<p>“Dry matches have saved many a man’s life,”
he was wont to say.</p>

<p>It was lonesome in the deep woods into which
Ralph plunged, after bidding adieu to his comrades.
The trail, too, was hard to follow, and
kept the lad on the alert, which was as well perhaps,
for it kept him from thinking of the solitude
of the mountain side. No one who has not
penetrated the vast solitudes of the Canadian
Rockies can picture just what the boding silence,
the utter solitude of the untrodden woods is like.
And yet the life in the wilds grows upon men
till they love it, as witness the solitary prospectors,
packers and trappers to be met in all the
wilder parts of the American continent.</p>

<p>As he trudged along toilsomely, Ralph kept a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
look out for game as well as for the trail, for the
camp larder needed replenishing with fresh meat,
and he was anxious to bring home his share. In
this way he covered some three or four miles,
now losing the elusive trail, now picking it up
again. The mountain side was steep and rocky
and strewn with the fallen trunks of forest
giants. But Ralph’s muscles were tough, and
clean living and athletics had given him sinew
and staying power, so that he was conscious of
but little fatigue after a long stretch of such
traveling.</p>

<p>Almost as skillfully as Coyote Pete might have
done in those days in the southwest, the boy read
the trail. Here the ponies had galloped. There
they had paused and nibbled grass; in other
places, broken boughs or abrasions on a fallen
tree trunk marked their path. There were two
of the ponies; but just which pair they were,
Ralph had, of course, no means of determining.</p>

<p>One thing was plain, they must have been badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
frightened; for as has been said in the mountain
solitudes, as a rule, ponies will stick close
to camp. They appear to dread being separated
from human companionship, and few packers or
trailers ever find it necessary to tether their animals.</p>

<p>At last the ridge was topped and beyond him,
by clambering on a rock, Ralph looked into a
deep valley with ridge on ridge of mountains rising
beyond it, and beyond them again some snow-capped
peaks of considerable height. He
scanned the valley as closely as he could, but big
timber grew thickly on its sides and bottom and
he was not able to see much. There were some
open spaces, it is true, but in none of these could
he see anything of the missing ponies.</p>

<p>Ralph sat himself down on the flat-topped rock
he had climbed, and pulling a bit of chocolate out
of his pocket, began to nibble it. He was munching
away on his lunch when he saw an odd-looking
gray bird, not unlike a partridge, sitting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a hemlock not far from him. The bird did not
appear to be scared and regarded the boy with
its head cocked inquisitively on one side.</p>

<p>“Well, here goes Number One for the pot,”
thought Ralph to himself.</p>

<p>He raised his rifle, and taking careful aim fired
at the gray bird. But his hand was shaking
somewhat from the exertions of his climb, during
which he had had to haul himself over many
rough places by grabbing branches, and his bullet
flew wide.</p>

<p>“Bother it all,” exclaimed the boy impatiently.
“I am a muff for fair.”</p>

<p>But to his astonishment, although the bullet
had nicked off some leaves and showered them
over the bird’s head, it had not moved. It still
sat there giving from time to time an odd sort of
croaking sound, not unlike the clucking of a barnyard
“biddy.”</p>

<p>“I know what you are now,” chuckled Ralph
to himself, for the fact that the bird did not stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
helped him to recognize its species from a description
given the night before by Mountain
Jim, “you’re a ‘fool-hen,’ and you are certainly
living up to your name.”</p>

<p>He fired again, and this time the “fool-hen”
paid the penalty of its stupidity, for it fell out
of the tree dead. Ralph ran forward, picked it
up and thrust it into the hunting pocket of his
khaki coat.</p>

<p>“It was a shame to shoot you,” he muttered to
himself; “too easy. I believe the stories that Jim
told about knocking fool-hens out of trees with
stones, now that I’ve seen what dumb birds they
are. But this isn’t finding those ponies,” he
went on to himself. “Guess I’ll strike off down
in the valley. There may be some sort of pasture
there where they’ll have stopped to feed.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped and sniffed the air suspiciously.
An odd, rank odor was borne to him
on the light wind.</p>

<p>“Sulphur spring!” he exclaimed half aloud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
“Reckon I’ll take a look at it. It can’t be far
off; it’s strong enough to be right under my feet.
At any rate I shan’t need any other guide than
my nose to find it.”</p>

<p>Sniffing the tainted air like a hound on the
trail, Ralph set out down the mountain side. As
he went the odor grew more pronounced. A few
minutes later he came upon a pile of rocks heaped
in an untidy mass on the mountain side. From
the midst of them a stream of yellowish white
fluid was flowing.</p>

<p>“Phew!” exclaimed the boy, “here’s my sulphur
spring, sure enough. I guess if it was near
to civilization there’d be a big health resort here.
Smells bad enough to be good for anything that
ails you; but&mdash;not for me, thank you.&mdash;Hullo!
What in the world was that?”</p>

<p>Ralph paused and listened intently. Through
the forest came a dull booming sound, and the
earth appeared to shake as if agitated by a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
earthquake. The boy looked about him apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Well, what in the world!” he began. And
then, “It can’t be anybody blasting. Mountain
Jim said there was no mining hereabouts. What
can it be?”</p>

<p>For some odd reason the recollection of the
man on the rock recurred to him. His heart began
to pound rather faster than was comfortable.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” he exclaimed, to quiet his nerves,
“I’ve got nothing to fear. I’ve got my rifle and&mdash;Great
Scott! It’s raining!”</p>

<p>That was the boy’s first thought as a gentle
pattering resounded amidst the trees about where
he stood.</p>

<p>He looked upward; but the sky was clear; the
sun shining brightly. Clearly the pattering was
not caused by rain.</p>

<p>“What in the world can it be?” he exclaimed,
considerably startled. “Sounds as if somebody
was throwing stones or gravel at me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The next minute a large globule of mud struck
him in his upturned face. Apparently it had fallen
from the sky. It was followed by a perfect
storm of the mud dobs. They pattered about
him in a shower, spattering his clothes and hands.</p>

<p>“It’s raining mud!” gasped the astonished boy,
completely at a loss to account for the phenomenon.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">JUST IN TIME.</p>

<p>Once more the odd booming sound was borne
to Ralph’s ears. It came from off to his left.
The mud fell again in showers all about him.</p>

<p>“It’s some sort of a boiling spring!” exclaimed
Ralph suddenly. “I’ll bet a doughnut that’s
what it is. What a chump I was to think that the
man on the rock had anything to do with it. Yet
it did give me a scare for a minute, too.”</p>

<p>He dashed off in the direction of the booming
sound, eager to see what he was certain now had
caused the shower of mud. He soon came upon
it. In a little clear space amidst the pines he
found himself in marshy ground. Rank green
grass and flowers of bright colors grew here, and
brilliantly colored dragon-flies shot hither and
thither through the moist, warm air. The atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
held a steamy, unwholesome sort of
dampness.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a rumbling sound which
quickly changed to a roar like that of a locomotive
blowing off steam, and from the center of
the clearing there shot up a clear stream of
steaming water. But in a flash its purity was
sullied and it turned a dark muddy color. The
rumbling increased in violence and a miniature
geyser of mud and steaming hot water was shot
upward to a considerable height.</p>

<p>Ralph made a swift dash for the shelter of a
Douglas fir and looked on curiously while the
convulsion of nature lasted. Then he ventured
out to examine the geyser more closely. To his
disappointment he found that he could not approach
the depression from which the mud and
water had been spouted upward. The ground
was far too swampy to permit such a proceeding
and the boy was compelled to look on at the
strange sight from a distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The convulsions occurred with almost clock-like
regularity, at intervals of about ten minutes.
As he watched, Ralph thought of the professor,
and how delighted the man of science would have
been to behold such a sight. He made careful
mental notes of the operations of the mud geyser,
however, so that he could be sure to give an
accurate account of it to the professor when he
returned.</p>

<p>Suddenly, behind him, he heard an odd, rustling
sort of noise and noticed a movement in the
tall grass. He parted the vegetation to see what
could be causing the disturbance. The next instant
he leaped backward with a spring that
would have done credit to a gymnast.</p>

<p>He had almost stepped on a huge rattlesnake
that was coiled in the grass. All at once he became
aware that in his backward spring he had
nearly landed on another of the reptiles, a snake
fully five feet in length. This caused the boy to
beat a precipitate retreat, choosing open ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
for the purpose. It was not till then that he began
to notice that the entire vicinity of the hot
springs was fairly alive with the scaly reptiles.
Undoubtedly they had been attracted there by
the warmth of the ground and had a den in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” exclaimed the boy with a shudder, “I
never did like snakes. I guess I’ll get out of this
as quickly as possible. Some of those fellows
beat anything I saw in Arizona. I don’t fancy
their company.”</p>

<p>He retraced his steps to the point where he
had left the trail of the missing ponies and took
it up once more. It led down into the valley and
Ralph, thinking of the scores of serpents that
must haunt the vicinity of the geyser, followed
it with a thankful feeling that he had seen the
rattlers in time to avoid them.</p>

<p>The traveling down the side of the ridge on
which he was now was almost as hard as his
clamber up the opposite acclivity. To make matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
worse he encountered several muskegs smelling
strongly of sulphur, and undoubtedly fed by
the sulphurous springs higher up the hill. But
the boy was grateful for one thing that the softer
ground did for him. It made the traveling
harder, but, at the same time, it held the prints of
the runaways’ hoofs as clear as day; and as well
as Ralph could judge from the look of their
prints they were fairly fresh, and told him that
he could not be far from the strays.</p>

<p>This encouraged him greatly, and he made
good time down the hillside, strewn though the
way was with obstacles. He was traveling forward
thus, when from a patch of flowering
shrubs ahead there came a rustle and a crackling.</p>

<p>Ralph’s heart jumped into his mouth. Mountain
Jim had declared that the ponies had been
scared by a cougar or a bear. Could the creature
be just beyond him in that clump of shrubs?</p>

<p>He examined his rifle carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t want to be treed again,” he said to
himself.</p>

<p>So far as he could see, the rifle was in perfect
working order. He stood stock still and waited
for a recurrence of the disturbance in the bushes.</p>

<p>But following the rustling that had first attracted
his attention no sound came. Ralph’s excited
imagination showed him a tawny side a dozen
times or more, only to be followed by the discovery
that it was some dead or faded leaves and
not the flank of a bear or cougar that he had
spied.</p>

<p>“If something doesn’t happen pretty quick, I’m
going to blow up!” exclaimed the boy to himself
as he waited, hardly daring to breathe.</p>

<p>All at once there came from the patch of bushes
a renewed rustling. It was coming toward
him. Ralph clutched his rifle tightly and bit his
under lip to keep his nerves under control. The
sound was growing nearer now. Was it a bear,
or a stealthy, cat-like cougar that was destined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to emerge in an instant from its place of concealment?</p>

<p>“It’s coming,” thought Ralph, with a bound of
his heart, “I hope I can shoot straight and finish
it with one shot.”</p>

<p>He threw up his gun in anticipation and the
next instant burst into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>From the bush had emerged, not a bear nor
a mountain lion, nor even a deer.</p>

<p>Facing Ralph, and quite as much astonished
as he, to judge by its attitude, was a large Canada
hare. For an instant boy and hare stood looking
at each other, while Ralph shook with laughter
over his feelings of trepidation as to what the
brush would bring forth.</p>

<p>“Talk about the mountain and the mouse,” he
chuckled to himself. “This sure is a modern version
of the old fable.”</p>

<p>“Skip along, bunny,” he added the next instant,
as the hare, with a spring and a whisk of its
stumpy tail, vanished down the mountain side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
seeking cover, “I wouldn’t take as easy a shot as
that, especially when I was looking for big game.”</p>

<p>But the next minute he was destined to get another
surprise. Something was coming toward
him from another direction, from his right. He
could hear its footsteps as it advanced somewhat
heavily, cracking branches and twigs.</p>

<p>Then among the tree trunks and underbrush
he saw something move. A brown object it appeared
to be.</p>

<p>“A deer!” flashed through Ralph’s mind. “I’m
in luck to-day.”</p>

<p>With eager eyes riveted on the spot where he
had last seen the brown object, Ralph raised his
rifle. His hands trembled but he steadied them
with an effort, fighting off the attack of “buck
fever,” as a hunter’s excitement at the prospect
of big game is termed.</p>

<p>Suddenly the brown object appeared again,
bobbing about behind a clump of brambles.</p>

<p>“It’s a deer’s head, sure!” breathed Ralph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew a careful bead on the object, devoutly
hoping that his sights were adjusted right for
the range, which was about a hundred yards.</p>

<p>“Now for it,” he said to himself, as he prepared
to press the trigger.</p>

<p>But the shot was never fired, for just as Ralph
was about to send a bullet crashing from his
weapon there stepped into view from behind the
brush, <i>the figure of a man</i>!</p>

<p>Ralph shook as if from a fever. Another instant
and he might have been a murderer! The
man had revealed himself in the nick of time.
But hardly had Ralph discovered his mistake
when the man saw him. Without a word he
dashed off like a wild animal, crouching and diving
as he went, and in a flash was out of sight.</p>

<p>In the brief interval that Ralph had had to
scrutinize the man he had so nearly shot, he had
not received more than a general impression as
to what he looked like. But this impression was
startling enough. It was of a creature bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with a hairy growth that reached almost to his
waist, half naked and with long, unkempt hair
and wild eyes.</p>

<p>But even so, he had a queer intuition that this
half wild creature and the silent watcher on the
rock were one and the same individual.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">BOYS AND A GRIZZLY.</p>

<p>Hardware and Persimmons found pretty much
the same traveling as Ralph. But not as experienced
as he in following a trail, they did not advance
so fast. Luckily, as it so fell out for them,
the pony that they were trailing was one known
as White-eye. He was a harum-scarum sort of
a brute, and for that reason Mountain Jim had
fastened round his neck, the night before, a lariat
with a heavy stone attached to it. The stone
had left a plainly swept path through the woods,
and except in one or two baffling places the boys
had followed it without much difficulty.</p>

<p>Instead of keeping to the open mountain side,
like Ralph’s quarry, White-eye had made his way
up a gully that cut deep into the hills, leading in
a diagonal slash to the north. The two lads followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the bottom of the gully as far as it led and
then, still following the trail of the stone attached
to White-eye’s neck, they made their way
up a rough, rock-strewn slope to the summit of
the ridge.</p>

<p>Unlike the country Ralph had struck, Hardware
and his companion found themselves, on the
summit of the ridge, in a forest of white birch
and shady green timber, amidst which the sunlight
filtered down cheerfully. Passing through
this they emerged on a rocky hillside thickly
grown with “scotch-caps,” or sackatoons, Rocky
Mountain blueberries and snake berries, while
under foot was a carpet of red heather.</p>

<p>The boys ate heartily of the blueberries and
scotch caps, but one taste of the snake berries
was enough for them. They were bitter and
nauseating to a degree, although Mountain Jim
had told them that bears preferred them to any
other berry.</p>

<p>“No accounting for tastes,” commented Hardware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in this connection, “and speaking of bears,
I wonder if there are any hereabouts?”</p>

<p>“Bucking blueberries, I hope not,” exclaimed
Persimmons, looking about him in some trepidation.
“I’d like to have Mountain Jim along if we
are going to run into anything like that.”</p>

<p>“This looks like the sort of country he said
bears frequented,” was Hardware’s response. “I
don’t see why we should be scared to meet one,
either.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’d go right up and say ‘Goodmorning,
bear,’” snorted Persimmons.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got our rifles, and they are supposed
to be powerful enough to bring down any
bear, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Howling hammerheads, what’s the matter
now?”</p>

<p>The question was a natural one, for Hardware
had stopped short and was staring ahead of them
down the steep hillside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, something’s moving down there. It
may be a bear. Get your rifle ready.”</p>

<p>Hardware’s face took on a determined expression
and he looked to the mechanism of his rifle
and slipped a magazine into place. Persimmons
did the same, muttering to himself as he did so
that it was no use fighting a bear, and that they’d
better give Bruin a wide berth.</p>

<p>But the next instant their anxiety was relieved
and gave place to high good humor. The object
Hardware had spied moving among the rocks
and brambles was not a grizzly, but the recreant
White-eye, cropping the grass as he moved about.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up and saw the boys. With
upraised head and pricked ears he watched their
advance.</p>

<p>“Goodness! I hope he will let us get near him,”
said Hardware. “I don’t much fancy a chase
through this sort of country.”</p>

<p>“He looks as wild as a hawk,” was his companion’s
response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed White-eye did not appear as if he meant
to be docilely captured.</p>

<p>As the boys cautiously crept forward, trying
to avoid any action that might startle him, the
pony rolled his eyes back in the manner that had
given him his name and extended his nostrils,
sniffing the air suspiciously. Both boys had
brought along some grain in their pockets, out
of the supply carried for emergencies, and now
Hardware dipped his hand into his pocket and
extended it, full of oats, for White-eye’s inspection.</p>

<p>But seemingly, the pony had no mind to be
caught just then. He gave a plunge and snort
and dashed off.</p>

<p>“Oh, gracious!” groaned Hardware. “There
he goes, lickety-split; it doesn’t look as if we’d
ever catch him.”</p>

<p>“Howling hen-roosts, no!” gasped Persimmons,
who had just barked his shin on a sharp
rock. “And I tell you one thing, Hardware, I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
not going to chase very far after him. Hullo,
what’s he doing now?”</p>

<p>White-eye had paused with startling suddenness
in his mad career, and the next minute the
boys realized what had caused his abrupt stoppage.
His long tether, with the stone attached,
had caught around the stump of a sage bush as
it bounded down the hill, and twisted round the
stump two or three times had captured the runaway
as effectually as if he had been tied by human
hands.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I call luck,” declared Hardware
fervently.</p>

<p>“It’s all of that and then some,” responded
Persimmons puffingly.</p>

<p>“Let’s hurry up, he may get loose again,”
urged his companion, and the two boys hastened
forward regardless of brambles or rocks.</p>

<p>In a jiffy they had the lariat untied and were
holding tightly on to it, prepared for another
wild dash on the part of White-eye. But now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that they had hold of the rope, the pony appeared,
with equine wisdom, to perceive that further
resistance was useless. He followed docilely
enough while they led him up the hillside.</p>

<p>“I hope the others have had as good luck,” remarked
Hardware as they trudged along.</p>

<p>“I hope so, too,” responded Persimmons, “I
wouldn’t wish my worst enemy any more of this
kind of work than could be helped.”</p>

<p>But just as they were congratulating themselves
on the easy capture of the stray a sudden
demon appeared to enter White-eye’s being. He
started leaping and bucking and snorting as if
possessed.</p>

<p>“What on earth is the matter with him now?”
gasped Hardware in wonderment.</p>

<p>“Bucking beefsteaks, he acts like he had a bad
tummy ache,” exclaimed Persimmons; “maybe
he’s been eating some of those snake berries.
They’re enough to make anybody cut up if he
takes too many of them, and one’s a-plenty&mdash;wow!
Look! Harry! Look there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The cause of White-eye’s sudden alarm became
startlingly apparent. From a patch of blueberries
just ahead of them, where he had evidently
been feeding, a great brown form arose on
its hind legs and stood looking at them.</p>

<p>“A g-g-g-g-grizzly!” yelled Hardware, quite
forgetting his rifle that was slung over his back
by a bandolier.</p>

<p>“Run! Run for your life!” shouted Persimmons,
equally forgetful of his weapon, which, in
order to lead White-eye, he had been compelled
to sling over his shoulders in a similar way.</p>

<p>The bear dropped on all fours and began coming
toward them without undue haste, but with
a sort of deadly deliberation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">A CAVERN OF MYSTERY.</p>

<p>Snorting and plunging, White-eye wheeled and
dashed off down the hillside. When they had
first re-captured him, the two boys had, for greater
ease in leading him, fastened the rope through
their belts. They were heartily sorry for this
now.</p>

<p>As the pony turned and plunged off, they only
managed to keep their feet by an effort, and the
next instant they were perforce flying down the
steep mountain side attached to the leading rope
of the frightened pony.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the going was too rough for
White-eye to be able to make his full speed, otherwise
they might have been dragged off their
feet and seriously injured. As it was, their united
weight and the rugged hillside both combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to slacken the pony’s runaway gallop and enabled
them to keep upright. But even so, they were
hauled through brambles and brush, scratching
their hands unmercifully and tearing even the
stout fabric of their hunting clothes.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary situation. First came
the terrified pony, making every effort to escape
from the bear. Behind him, towed at the end of
the rope and helpless to relieve the stress of their
predicament, came the two boys. Behind them
again lumbered the bear, apparently not in any
particular hurry, but still getting over the ground
uncomfortably fast for those he was pursuing.</p>

<p>The two boys had no opportunity to exchange
words as they were remorselessly hastened along.
Hardware made an effort to reach his knife, but
he was unable to do so and carry out his intention
of cutting the rope. Even if he could have done
this, their situation would not have been much
improved. There would still have remained the
bear to be reckoned with, and both boys were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
badly flustered that it is doubtful if they could
have used their rifles effectively.</p>

<p>Suddenly Harry Ware, who had cast a glance
behind him, gave a yell. “He’s coming faster!”</p>

<p>The bear had quit his leisurely rolling canter
and was now advancing at a pace that appeared
incredibly swift for so cumbrous and awkward
an animal. He looked like a flying ball of fur as
his short legs flashed under his heavy body.</p>

<p>It seemed inevitable that the chase was to come
to a sudden termination. Every instant the
frightened boys expected to feel the creature’s
great claws pull them down.</p>

<p>But suddenly, something as startling as it was
entirely unexpected occurred.</p>

<p>White-eye vanished from view ahead of them.</p>

<p>One instant they had seen him straining and
tugging on the rope by which they were being so
unwillingly towed along. The next minute the
earth appeared to open and swallow him.</p>

<p>Simultaneously both boys were jerked off their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
feet by a sharp tug on the rope. They felt themselves
being rushed forward over the rough
ground and yanked through a clump of scratching
“scotch-cap” bushes.</p>

<p>A moment later they both gave a shout of terror
as they felt themselves falling into a dark
hole. Then came a plunge and a sudden bump as
they fetched up their career through space by
abruptly alighting on something soft and warm.</p>

<p>For a time, so badly shaken were they by their
fall and by terror, that neither spoke. Then Persimmons’
voice came through the darkness.</p>

<p>“Rocketing radishes! are you dead, Hardware?”</p>

<p>“No, are you?” came the answer in a quavering
voice.</p>

<p>“Not even scratched. But where under the sun
are we?”</p>

<p>“At present we are lying on White-eye’s body.
Poor brute, I guess he’s dead.”</p>

<p>“But he saved our lives. If he hadn’t fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
first to the bottom of this hole, or whatever it is,
we’d have been killed or had our bones broken,
sure.”</p>

<p>“Not much doubt of that. But what are we
going to do now?”</p>

<p>“Get out of this place.”</p>

<p>“But how? Can you suggest a way? Look
up above.”</p>

<p>Peering over the top of the hole, which was
some twenty feet above them, was a shaggy head.
As he gazed over into the hole down which his
prey had so unexpectedly vanished, the bear gave
a growl and shook his great head, while his red
jaws slavered and dripped.</p>

<p>“Well, this hole in the ground, or cave, or
whatever it is, saved us from that bear at any
rate,” declared Persimmons.</p>

<p>“Yes; but it looks as if we had got out of the
frying pan into the fire,” retorted his companion
disgustedly. “Why didn’t we think to use our
rifles? We’re a fine pair of hunters, we are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“We couldn’t have used them, anyhow,” was
Persimmons’ response.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because, like Mazeppa, we were hitched to a
fiery steed, only we trailed along instead of being
on his back. Poor beast, he must have been
killed instantly by his tumble.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. His head is doubled under his
body. His neck must have been broken.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is a fine end to our horse hunt. I
guess we’ll have to wait here till they come along
and find us.”</p>

<p>“Looks that way,” was the moody reply. “At
any rate I’m going to have a shot at the cause
of all our trouble.”</p>

<p>“All right, if you miss, give me a chance at
him.”</p>

<p>Harry Ware raised his rifle and fired directly
at the bear’s head as the great, shaggy creature
peered down into the dark hole. His shot was
echoed almost simultaneously by a report from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Persimmons’ rifle. There was no need for a
third.</p>

<p>The great head sank lifelessly and hung limply
over the edge of the hole above them.</p>

<p>“Good work!” cried young Simmons. “Now,
if we can only get out of here we can bring back
a pelt that will astonish them.”</p>

<p>“True enough; but the problem is how to get
out.”</p>

<p>“Let’s light up and see what sort of a place
we have got into.”</p>

<p>As he spoke Persimmons struck a match from
his pocket case and a yellow glow illumined their
surroundings. They had fallen into a sort of rift
in the hillside with a narrow opening in it
through which poor White-eye had plunged,
dragging them with him. But the light of the
match, even in the brief period it endured,
showed them that it would be impossible to clamber
out by the way they had so unceremoniously
entered. The hole, or rift, was larger at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
bottom than the top, and they would have had to
be able to walk upside down, like flies on a
sloping ceiling, to regain the mouth of the hole.</p>

<p>It was plain that they must find some other
means of egress. But how this was to be accomplished
was a puzzling question.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE HUT IN THE WOODS.</p>

<p>Following his first flush of surprise at the
strange reappearance and vanishment of the mysterious
man, Ralph was conscious of a feeling
closely akin to hot indignation.</p>

<p>“I’m going to catch him,” thought the lad
fiercely. “What does he mean by going on like
this? What’s he following us for and spying on
us? I’d like to find out what sort of tricks he
is up to, and I’m going to.”</p>

<p>So saying he set off through the woods at a
good pace, following as nearly as he could the
direction the man had taken. But it soon dawned
on him that he had undertaken an almost hopeless
task. Judging from the man’s appearance,
he had been a denizen of the woods for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
period, although just how he lived was not apparent.</p>

<p>At any rate, before he had gone far Ralph was
compelled to admit that there did not appear to be
much chance of his catching up with the man.
No sign of him was visible, and no crackling of
brush or sound of footsteps betrayed in what
direction he had gone.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll have to give it up,” mused Ralph
disgustedly. “At any rate I’m sure of one thing
now, I’ve got nothing to fear from this strange
customer, whatever may be his object in hanging
about us like this. He must have followed us
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ralph paused abruptly. He had last seen the
man on the other side of the <i>brulee</i>. It was
hardly likely that he could have passed through
such a tract of country. Yet, on the other hand,
the boy could not doubt that the man he had
seen on the rock overlooking their camp and the
wild figure of the valley were one and the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
There was a deep mystery about it all. One too
deep for the boy to fathom, for he broke off his
meditations with a sigh.</p>

<p>“It’s no use keeping up the chase to-day,” he
declared to himself with emphasis, “but if that
fellow keeps on dodging our tracks he’s going to
hear from me in no uncertain fashion.”</p>

<p>He rose from the stump on which he had sat
down to think things over and resumed his search
for the stray ponies. As he moved along he
munched his bread and chocolate, taking his
lunch “on the hoof,” so to speak.</p>

<p>Before long he struck the trail of the missing
ponies once more. This time it soon led him into
a swampy country and he followed it rapidly.
Along the floor of the valley he went till suddenly,
on coming around a pile of great rocks,
hurled from the summit of the ridge in some
prehistoric convulsion, he saw something that
gave him a big surprise. In a little clearing stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
a ruinous log cabin, and tethered outside it was
one of the missing ponies!</p>

<p>Of the other there was no trace. All at once
Ralph heard a scrambling and clambering among
the rocks above him on the steep hillside. He
glanced quickly and just in time to see the mysterious
man remounted on the other pony, rapidly
urging it away from the hut.</p>

<p>“Stop thief!” yelled Ralph, carried away by
excitement. “Come back here!”</p>

<p>“Stop or I’ll shoot!” he shouted the next instant
throbbing with indignation.</p>

<p>He had no intention of hitting the fugitive, but
he did mean to frighten him into stopping if he
could. For an instant the form of the stolen
pony and its rider became visible among the trees
through which the afternoon sun was sending
down oblique shafts of light.</p>

<p>Ralph raised his rifle, sighted it to carry a
bullet well above the fugitive’s head and fired.</p>

<p>“The next will come closer,” he warned; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the next minute all other thoughts were rushed
abruptly out of his mind when a bullet whizzed
by his head close enough to fan his ear. The
ping-g-g-g-g-g-g of the ball as it sped by, ruffling
his hair, did not appeal to Ralph. Evidently
the fugitive was a dead shot and was not
inclined to be pursued if he could avoid it by putting
his tracker out of the way.</p>

<p>“Jove!” exclaimed Ralph as he slipped behind
a tree trunk, “that bullet was a message meant
for me, all right. I don’t care to be at home to
such callers.”</p>

<p>He listened an instant and then came the sound
of the pony’s hoofs making off at a good pace
through the trackless forest.</p>

<p>“He’s escaped me again,” exclaimed Ralph
angrily. “Confound him, he’s worse than a
mystery now. I’ll bet that it was he who stampeded
the ponies last night and now he turns out
to be a miserable horse thief. Wonder if I can’t
get a clew to him at that hut yonder? At any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
rate there’s Baldy tied up and safe and sound as
ever. I suppose I ought to thank our mysterious
friend for leaving him behind.”</p>

<p>The boy slipped from behind his tree trunk and
made his way toward the hut. Baldy whinnied
as the boy approached. It was plain that the
pony was glad to see him.</p>

<p>“Good Baldy! Good old pony,” exclaimed
Ralph, slapping the animal’s thigh and then giving
him some bread. “I wish you could talk,
old fellow, and then maybe you could throw some
light on what in creation all this means anyhow.”</p>

<p>Ralph then looked all about him with much
curiosity. The hut was moss-grown and moldering
into decay. Judged from its exterior it had
not been lived in for many years. At the rear
of it a spring bubbled into a rusty iron pot beside
which lay a rust-eaten dipper.</p>

<p>The door of the shack&mdash;windows it had none&mdash;hung
on one crazy hinge made of raw-hide.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll take a look inside,” said Ralph, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
a very lively curiosity, “but from general appearances
I don’t think our mysterious friend and
horse thief actually lives here. Looks to me more
as if he used it as a temporary camping place.
Yet he could hardly have found his way here
unless he previously knew of its existence.”</p>

<p>Cautiously, and with his rifle ready for a surprise,
for he did not know what he might encounter
next, Ralph entered the hut. It smelled
moldy and stuffy, and in the dim light he could
not at first see very much of its interior.</p>

<p>Bit by bit the details began to grow out of
the gloom. In the center of the shack was a
rough board table and on it stood some rusted
plates and cups. In a corner hung some old garments
and a few moldering furs, skins of raccoons
and minks. A rusty stove stood in another
corner, one leg missing and sagging drunkenly.</p>

<p>By the door Ralph now noticed a yellow bit of
paper tacked up, with some writing on it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
came closer to read it and made out in faded
characters:</p>

<p>“Gone on April 16, 1888, Jess Boody, Trapper.”</p>

<p>This inscription made one thing plain to Ralph.
The hut had once been occupied by one of those
solitaries of the wilds whose trap lines are sometimes
forty or fifty miles long. This Jess Boody
had been such a man and had either “made his
pile,” or getting disgusted with the location as
a source for peltries had, as he tersely put it,
“gone on.”</p>

<p>There were no traces of more recent occupancy
of the hut, and Ralph was compelled to come back
to his first theory; the mysterious man had used
the place simply as a convenient shelter from time
to time. Some ashes in the stove, that looked
fairly fresh, appeared to lend color to this belief.
Probably the horse thief had spent the night
there.</p>

<p>“Well, if this hasn’t the makings of a first-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
mystery about it,” gasped Ralph, pushing
back his sombrero and running one hand through
his curly hair.</p>

<p>As there seemed to be no use in making any
further investigation of the tumble-down shanty,
Ralph untied the pony left behind by the horse
thief, and mounting it rode back toward camp
in a thoughtful mood. He was deeply puzzled,
and small wonder, by the events of the day.</p>

<p>He reached camp that evening shortly before
dusk, and found that Mountain Jim had returned
with the ponies that he had been after and which
he had found in a glade across another ridge.
The professor, and Jimmie, too, had had a successful
day, having gathered in almost a sackful
of what the professor called “specimens,” and
Mountain Jim “rocks.” But of Harry Ware
and Percy Simmons there was no sign.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">“UNDERGROUND!”</p>

<p>Harry Ware struck another match. This time
the two imprisoned lads did not bother to look
above them. They knew that escape in that
direction was an impossibility. Instead, they
turned their attention to their immediate surroundings.</p>

<p>Suddenly Percy Simmons gave a cry of
triumph.</p>

<p>“Look! See there, Hardware, old boy, isn’t
that a crack or fissure in the rock?”</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” responded his companion, who
had just time to notice the crack in the rock wall
of their prison before the light of the match died
out.</p>

<p>“Maybe we can get out that way,” sputtered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Persimmons, all agog at the thought that a
means of escape had been opened to them.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can, but it looks pretty narrow,”
responded Hardware dubiously. “Anyhow, it’s
worth trying. Strike another match and we’ll
have a good look at it.”</p>

<p>A second inspection showed the boys that the
fissure, though narrow, was sufficiently wide for
them to squeeze into in all probability. Although
in the event that it grew smaller further on, they
would be as badly off as before. Still, as Harry
Ware had said, it was worth trying, and the
two boys clambered off the body of the unfortunate
pony and began forcing their way into
the fissure. Harry Ware went first and Percy
Simmons, who was stouter, followed close behind.</p>

<p>For a distance of some five feet they managed
to forge ahead. But suddenly Persimmons gave
a grunt.</p>

<p>“I’m stuck, Harry, I can’t get any further.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Too bad; I guess we’ll have to turn back,”
Hardware started to say, when he gave a cry of
delight.</p>

<p>“It’s all right. It broadens out beyond here.
Come on, Percy, you can squeeze through alright.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” declared the stouter of the two
youths valiantly, and, with a violent effort, he
forced himself forward. It cost him almost all
the breath in his body, but he succeeded in passing
the narrow place and then found himself
beside his companion in what appeared to be a
much larger space beyond. Another match was
struck which revealed the place into which they
had forced their way as a circular cave with a
dome-like roof from which water dripped in a
constant shower.</p>

<p>It was cold and damp and the boys shuddered
as the water, which was icy cold, pattered about
them as if a violent rainstorm was in progress.</p>

<p>“Ugh! What sort of a place have we landed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
now, I’d like to know,” muttered Percy Simmons.
“Shivering snakes, it’s like a Cave of the Rains,
or something of that kind.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. We can’t stay here; it’s like being
in a damp ice box. We must find some way
out.”</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose we are, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Evidently in some subterranean cavern or
passage that runs under the hillside.”</p>

<p>“The question is, where does it come out?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll have to see. There must be
a way out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” assented Persimmons with
suspicious eagerness.</p>

<p>Neither boy dared to admit, even to himself,
that it was altogether a possibility that there
might not be any way out; in which case they
would be in as bad a fix as before. As for waiting
at the bottom of the hole down which White-eye
had pulled them, it was beginning to grow
painfully apparent that they might stand a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
chance of remaining there till Doomsday without
anyone discovering their whereabouts.</p>

<p>Once more matches were struck and they
gazed eagerly about them. They fully realized
now that it was becoming a matter of life and
death to them to find some means of escape from
this underground prison into which, through no
fault of their own, they had blundered.</p>

<p>But rigidly as they inspected their prison, it
was some time before they found that on one
side of the cavern a low archway in the rock led
into what appeared to be another rift in the
rocky formation underlying the mountain side.</p>

<p>“Shall we try it?” asked Hardware as his
sixth match fluttered out.</p>

<p>“Unanimous unicorns, yes!” was the energetic
reply. “We can’t stay here, and it’s no use going
back.”</p>

<p>“Good, the word is forward, then.”</p>

<p>Hardware, as he spoke, bent low to get under
the archway of living rock, which, centuries before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
had been tunneled out during some disturbance
of the earth, and once more the boys
found themselves in a narrow rift through which
they could barely squeeze.</p>

<p>“Gracious, if this gets any narrower we are
stuck for fair,” gasped Persimmons, as they
shoved and panted through the darkness.</p>

<p>“Don’t think of that; just say to yourself,
‘We’ve got to get out of this,’” urged young
Simmons’ companion.</p>

<p>In this way they went forward for some distance
further when the rift began to widen once
more. Suddenly they collided with a solid wall
of rock. It appeared that the rift had come to
an end.</p>

<p>“Shivering centipedes, we’re stuck!” groaned
Persimmons abjectly.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” counseled his companion,
“wait till I strike another match. Thank goodness,
we brought a good supply of them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s a lucky thing that Mountain Jim insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
on our filling the match safes. We’d be in
an awful fix without them.”</p>

<p>To the huge delight of the boys, the light
showed them that the rift branched off in two
directions at the point they had reached. They
had bumped into the rocky wall that formed the
apex of the triangle at which the two new passages
met the old one.</p>

<p>But now they faced a fresh problem. Which
passage would they take? They tossed a coin.
Heads would be the right-hand one, tails the
left. The coin indicated the right-hand rift
and into it, accordingly, they struck off. The
floor of the passage appeared to rise abruptly and
they soon found their further progress blocked
by a rocky wall.</p>

<p>“Perishing panhandles, what’ll we do now?”
gasped young Simmons.</p>

<p>“Try the other one,” was his companion’s brief
response.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">A DESPERATE CHANCE.</p>

<p>The other passage proved to be much the same
as the one they had tried.</p>

<p>“I hope this doesn’t end in nothing,” muttered
Hardware as they made their way along it.</p>

<p>They took a few steps more when Harry
Ware gave a sudden yell of alarm and surprise.</p>

<p>“W-w-what’s up now?” gasped out Persimmons;
but before Harry could reply both boys
found themselves tumbling downward. The
bottom appeared suddenly to have dropped out
of the cavern passage.</p>

<p>“We’re lost!” choked out Persimmons as he
felt his feet go from under him.</p>

<p>Neither boy knew anything more till they
found themselves lying on the ground, Persimmons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
stretched across Hardware’s recumbent
body.</p>

<p>“Whew! The second tumble to-day,” gasped
out young Simmons, “this place is as full of holes
as a porous plaster. Are you hurt, Harry?”
For poor Hardware had given a groan.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is, I don’t know. Ouch! I’ve bust
my ankle, I think.” The boy gave a loud moan,
which rang hollowly against the walls of the dismal
place.</p>

<p>“Is it badly hurt?” gasped Persimmons in a
dismayed tone.</p>

<p>“Get up off me and I’ll try to stand up. Give
me a hand to rise. That’s it&mdash;wow, but it’s painful!”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can use it, Harry?”</p>

<p>“Y-y-y-yes,” came bravely from poor Hardware,
who was suffering excruciating pain, “but
it feels as if a million little dwarfs were poking
needles in it.”</p>

<p>“Lean on me a minute. If we could only find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
some water, I’d bandage it. Say, we seem to be
the two most unlucky kids on earth!”</p>

<p>“That’s what. I wonder if we’ll ever get out
of this?”</p>

<p>Young Simmons made no reply. For the life
of him he could not have found words just at
that moment. It was all he could do to choke
back his sobs. He was a plucky enough lad, yet
he could hardly be blamed for feeling a pang of
black despair clutching at his heart as he revolved
in his mind their truly desperate situation.
After a minute he regained control of
himself, however.</p>

<p>“We’ll light up and have a look around,” he
said, as cheerily as he could. “I want to see what
sort of place it is that we’ve dropped in on so
unceremoniously.”</p>

<p>He struck a match; but it was instantly blown
out. Both lads now noticed for the first time
that quite a stiff breeze was blowing against their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
faces. The air felt fresh and chilly and evidently
came from some opening further along.</p>

<p>“Well, this breeze is a good sign,” declared
Hardware; “it means that this place must open
out somewhere along the route.”</p>

<p>“Blithering blizzards, that’s so!” cried young
Simmons with a gleam of his customary cheerfulness.
“Do you think you can walk, old man?”</p>

<p>“Oh; I’ll hobble along somehow,” declared
Harry Ware bravely.</p>

<p>“Lean on me and that will make it easier.
We’ll have to go slow, though. I’ve a notion
that one more drop would finish us.”</p>

<p>“Like aviation liniment,” responded Harry.</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“One drop is enough,” responded Harry with
a chuckle, despite his pain.</p>

<p>Both boys laughed, and somehow, as is often
the case, it made them feel better. As they advanced,
cautiously, as you may imagine after
their experiences, the breeze grew stronger till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
it fanned their faces in a regular gale. Their
clothes had got wet in the Cave of the Rains and
they felt chilled to the bone. But before long a
gray light sifted into the rift which presently
opened out above them, and looking up they could
catch a glimpse of the sky.</p>

<p>“Hurray! We’ll soon be out of here now!”
cried Harry squeezing his comrade’s shoulder on
which he was leaning heavily.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” was the response, “but hark!
what’s that?”</p>

<p>A roaring sound, not unlike that caused by a
train rushing through a tunnel broke on their
ears as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Goodness! Sounds like a den of wild beasts!”</p>

<p>But the next instant they found out what it
was that caused the roaring sound, and at the
same time experienced a shock of disappointment
as their hope of speedy release was rudely
dashed.</p>

<p>The rift terminated abruptly in a sort of rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
basin with steep sides topped with big trees and
brush. The center of this basin was a sort of
whirlpool formed by a stream which rushed in
at a fissure at one side and out of a similar crack
in the rocky walls at the other. A groan fairly
forced itself from the lips of both boys as they
gazed at the smooth, steep sides of the rock basin
and realized the impossibility of scaling them,
even had Harry’s ankle not been injured.</p>

<p>The stream entered the basin by a small waterfall
which tumbled in a foamy mass over great
rocks grown with green moss, and it was the
roaring of this that had caused the odd noise they
had heard in the tunnel.</p>

<p>“Stuck!” was Harry’s exclamation as they
stood on the foot-wide strip of beach on the
marge of the pool.</p>

<p>Percy Simmons could only echo his companion’s
exclamation. Utterly disheartened they
sank down on the strip of beach, the spray from
the waterfall dashing unnoticed in their faces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
For the first time since the beginning of their
misfortunes the two boys were on the verge of
giving way utterly.</p>

<p>How long they sat thus they didn’t know; but
it was Harry Ware who broke the silence. Both
boys were chilled to the bone, and their clothes
needed drying. Besides this, an idea had just
struck Harry. He thought that if any search
was made for them a column of smoke might be
a good thing to attract attention to their whereabouts,
and a good fire would serve a double purpose.</p>

<p>The beach was littered with all sorts of drift
wood, from big logs to small sticks that the
stream had brought down probably during a
spring freshet and which had lodged there.</p>

<p>When he had succeeded in rousing Percy from
his lethargy of despair, Harry limped briskly
about, helping his companion build a roaring fire.
The heat was grateful to their chilled skins, and
taking off their outer garments they spread them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
out to dry. It was while they were sitting thus,
discussing their situation with more cheerfulness
than hitherto they had been able to muster, that
Harry’s attention was caught by a partridge sitting
on a hemlock limb that overhung the rocky
basin on their side. Raising his rifle, which had
survived all accidents, he fired at it, and rather
to his surprise the bird came tumbling down,
landing almost at their feet.</p>

<p>“Come on, we’ll have some broiled partridge,
bread and chocolate,” he cried, addressing the
woebegone Persimmons. “It’s no good starving,
even if we are in a tight fix.”</p>

<p>He skinned and cleaned the bird and then
broiled it on a flat rock which he had previously
heated in the fire. The two boys ate the bird
hungrily, although it was not at all overdone,
being half raw, in fact. But their appetites were
too keen to be discriminating, and after despatching
it and eating some of their moist bread and
chocolate they felt much better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time it was midafternoon. Their
clothes were dry and after putting them on again,
they seated themselves on the margin of the pool
and discussed their plight.</p>

<p>“If only we had a boat!” mused Harry, after
some discussion.</p>

<p>“Jumping jellyfish, you’re right there, Harry,”
exclaimed Persimmons; “but just the same why
don’t you wish for an airship while you are
at it?”</p>

<p>“Because we can’t get an airship and we <i>can</i>
have a boat.”</p>

<p>“What! Have you gone crazy?”</p>

<p>“Never more serious in my life. I mean what
I say.”</p>

<p>“What, that we’ve got a boat?”</p>

<p>“No; what I mean is, that we can make one.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Persimmons, staring at his companion
as if to make sure that he was in possession
of his right senses.</p>

<p>“It’s no use looking at me like that, Perce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
I’m quite in earnest. The only question is, if
we make the boat, have you nerve enough to
ride on it?”</p>

<p>“I’d ride on anything to get out of this place.
I wish that eagle up yonder would come down
and offer to carry me out. You’d see how quick
I’d take him up. But honest, Harry, do you mean
what you say?”</p>

<p>“Surely. See that old log over there? That
one with the rope dangling from it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” rejoined his companion anticipatively.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon it drifted from some old lumber
camp or other and the rope came with it.
However, that’s not the point. The rope is on
it and we can ride on it out of this pool through
that rift in the rocks.”</p>

<p>“But the log will roll over with us.”</p>

<p>“That’s just where the rope comes in. We’ll
lash two of the logs together and then take our
chances. If we get spilled, why we can both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
swim and I’m pretty sure that outside this pool
we can find a bank to land on.”</p>

<p>“Inventive Indians! You’re a wonder, Harry.
I’d never have thought of that in a hundred
years. Come on, let’s get busy. The sun must
be getting pretty low, and if we do get out we’ve
got a long hike back to camp. I think”&mdash;he broke
off abruptly. “I forgot your ankle,” he exclaimed,
“you can’t walk far on that.”</p>

<p>“No, but you can leave me some place and get
help. That part will be all right. The main
thing is to reach some place from which you
can strike back to camp.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Well, let’s get busy and lash
two of the logs together and then try to chute
the chutes.”</p>

<p>A log of about the size of the stick of lumber
to which the rope was attached was secured and
rolled alongside it on the shelving beach. By
using smaller logs as levers the boys raised the
large ones and lashed them together as firmly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
they could, so as to form a sort of raft. The rope,
on testing proved to be lamentably old and rotten;
but the lads were not by this time in a mood
to be critical. They were crazy to escape from
their rock-walled <i>cul-de-sac</i>, and would have been
willing to dare almost anything that held out
even a remote hope of relief.</p>

<p>At length all was ready, and using their levers
they got their crude raft into the water. Then
they selected two poles which they thought might
come in handy to shove the craft off any obstructions
that it might strike. This done, they
were ready to make their adventurous dash.</p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Harry, wading out into
the water.</p>

<p>“Ready as I’ll ever be,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Get aboard then.”</p>

<p>Without further words both boys scrambled
upon the lashed logs and shoved off with their
poles. The next instant the raft was in deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
water. An eddy caught it, whirling it swiftly
into the middle of the pool.</p>

<p>“Wow! But it’s swifter than I thought,”
gasped Harry, as a wave swept over the raft.</p>

<p>His companion did not reply. At the instant he
was poling hard to keep the raft from being
swept against a rock, for he knew that the force
of a collision would, in all likelihood, cause the
logs to break apart. For a second the raft
swung round dizzily, waves and spray breaking
over it and drenching the boys afresh. The next
minute it was caught in the main current of the
stream and, like a flash, it shot through the rocky
rift of the basin and was hurtled down a passage
between steep cliffs, through which the waters
boiled like a mill race.</p>

<p>There was no opportunity to speak. The raft
was rushed onward with almost the speed of an
express train. Sick and dizzy from the violent
motion, drenched through, and thoroughly frightened,
the two boys could only crouch close and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
hang on for dear life. Once a sudden lurch almost
caused Harry to roll off, but young Simmons
caught him in the nick of time.</p>

<p>All at once, above the roar of the waters that
shot along through the rocky chasm, there came
a deeper diapason&mdash;a loud, thunderous sound
that proceeded from right ahead of them. Louder
it grew and louder, till its deafening uproar
drowned out all other sounds.</p>

<p>“What is it?” shouted Harry at the top of his
lungs, but to his comrade his voice sounded like
a whisper.</p>

<p>Then came a sudden shout from young Simmons
who had raised his head and glanced beyond
the plunging, dizzily swaying raft.</p>

<p>“Great goodness! We’re being swept toward a
waterfall. Get out the poles.”</p>

<p>“Pole off! Pole off!” yelled Harry, forgetting
his ankle and seizing up his pole as he rose to
his feet.</p>

<p>At the same instant there was a cracking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
rending sound, and the two boys were swept
asunder on separate logs.</p>

<p>The raft had parted under the strain and they
were carried helplessly toward the waterfall of
unknown height that boomed and thundered
ahead of them.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">FACING GRIM DEATH.</p>

<p>Of what occurred then, neither boy had in
the retrospect any clear idea. Over and over
they were rolled in a vortex of white water, each
clinging for dear life to his log. Then came a
plunge into a breathless abyss and, after what appeared
to be an eternity of submergence, they
rose to the surface, half-choked and blinded by
their immersion. There followed a fierce fight
with the boiling, foaming water at the base of
the fall, and then both boys found themselves
almost side by side in the quieter outer eddies of
the maelstrom.</p>

<p>“Are&mdash;you&mdash;hurt?” gasped out Harry.</p>

<p>“N-n-n-n-no. Are&mdash;you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. But&mdash;what&mdash;sort&mdash;of&mdash;a&mdash;place
is&mdash;this&mdash;anyhow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t know. It’s&mdash;awful&mdash;wet&mdash;though.”</p>

<p>In spite of his peril, Harry could not help smiling
at Persimmons’ whimsical rejoinder.</p>

<p>Dashing the water from his eyes he resumed
swimming, pushing the log before him, for in
some mysterious way throughout the awful buffeting
they had received in their tumble through
the water, both boys had retained their hold on
their logs.</p>

<p>It was a rather difficult task to reach the shore,
for their wet clothing hampered them sadly and
they were greatly fatigued. At last their feet
encountered solid ground. Like two drowned
creatures they dragged themselves up the bank
of the pool beneath the fall and spread themselves
panting, on the grass, incapable for the moment
of either thought or speech.</p>

<p>“Woof!” panted Percy Simmons at length,
gazing back and upward at the fall, “do you mean
to say that we came down that and are still
alive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“So it seems. It’s a good thing we didn’t know
of the existence of that waterfall before we built
the raft.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Because in that case we would never have
had the nerve to use it.”</p>

<p>“Cantering cascades, I guess you are right!
That was the wildest ride I ever took in my life.”</p>

<p>“And the wildest you are ever likely to, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope so, anyhow. Hammering hummingbirds,
what a drop!”</p>

<p>Both boys gazed at the fall, which thundered
and boomed its white waters from a height that
appeared to be fully fifty feet above where they
lay, although in all probability the drop was not
half that altitude.</p>

<p>“Say, Persimmons,” murmured Harry presently.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Has it struck you that we are mighty lucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to be lying here safe and sound after all we’ve
been through?”</p>

<p>“You just bet it has,” was the hearty response.
“Walloping waterfalls, if it wasn’t that I’m so
hungry I’d think I was dead.”</p>

<p>“We’d better be seeing about getting back to
camp,” said Harry presently. “It’s getting late
and they’ll be worried to death over us.”</p>

<p>“Not half so worried as we were over ourselves
about twenty minutes ago,” breathed Persimmons
fervently.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. But look, the sun
is getting low. We’d better start.”</p>

<p>“Right you are; but how about your ankle?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t hurt half so much now. I guess
I can make it all right.”</p>

<p>“All right. But if it hurts you badly, I guess
I can carry you a way. Or maybe we can find
a hut of some trapper or something where you
can stay till I bring help.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Got your compass?” was Harry’s next question.</p>

<p>“Yes; but the sun would give us our direction
in any event. The camp must lie over that ridge
to the east.”</p>

<p>“Then we came under part of the hill and were
brought by that river down into the valley here.”</p>

<p>“That’s what. It seems funny to think of all
we’ve been through since we left camp this morning,
doesn’t it? I wish we could have brought
back poor old White-eye, though.”</p>

<p>“So do I. We’ll have to get another pony
some place, I guess.”</p>

<p>Talking thus, the two boys began to climb the
hill under whose rugged surface they had traveled
by that strange subterranean route, bored or
shaken out there when the world was in its infancy.
It was a strange thought that theirs were
the first human feet that, almost beyond a
doubt, had ever trod those gloomy rifts beneath
the earth’s surface. But being boys, they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
waste much time on speculations of this kind.
Instead, they munched what remained of their
chocolate, a sad, pulpy mess, and cheered themselves
as they trudged along by thoughts of a
camp fire and a hot supper.</p>

<p>They did not make very rapid progress. Although
Harry’s ankle was much improved, yet it
gave him pain as he walked, and from time to
time they were compelled to sit down and rest
on a rock or a log. Both boys still carried their
rifles by the bandoliers, and an examination had
shown that the water had not injured the almost
waterproof locks. But the weapons, although
lightweight, felt as heavy as lead on their tired
backs as they toiled up the rugged steeps.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Harry as they paused, not
far from the top of the ridge which they had
crossed that morning, “camping in the Canadian
Rockies isn’t all fun, is it?”</p>

<p>“Galloping grasshoppers, no!” was the fervent
rejoinder. “If this is what the professor calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
getting experience, I’d rather accumulate mine
in less strenuous fashion.”</p>

<p>“I imagine, though, that after a good night’s
rest and some supper we’ll feel different about
it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. But to-day we’ve done nothing but
tumble in.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and we were lucky to get out again every
time as easily as we did.”</p>

<p>“True for you. I guess there’s not so much
to grumble about after all.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, we got a fine bearskin. It will
help to remind us of this day every time we look
at it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I don’t need any reminder. I can
recollect it all perfectly well without a souvenir.”</p>

<p>They paused once more to rest Harry’s ankle,
when suddenly young Simmons gave a glad exclamation.</p>

<p>“Look, Harry! Over yonder among those
trees! There’s a man on horseback coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
toward us. Maybe we can get you a lift into
camp!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is some one from the camp. No;
it isn’t, though. Who can it be?”</p>

<p>Just then the solitary horseman emerged from
the shadow of the white birches that stood ghost-like
against their dark back-ground of pine. The
red glow of the setting sun streamed full upon
him, bathing both rider and horse in a flood of
crimson light.</p>

<p>“Why,&mdash;that’s&mdash;that’s one of our horses!” exclaimed
Harry suddenly.</p>

<p>“So it is. Maybe that fellow’s been sent out
to search for us. Wow, but he’s a wild-looking
customer, though!”</p>

<p>His shaggy hair, huge, unkempt beard and
ragged clothes did, indeed, give the horseman a
mysterious, almost uncanny look as, with head
bent down, he came riding out of the wood into
the sunset light. Suddenly he raised his head
and saw the two boys for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hey, mister!” cried young Simmons.</p>

<p>The next instant, with a wild cry like that of
some animal, the uncouth figure wheeled his pony
and dashed off into the wood from whence he
had come.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?” gasped
Persimmons, gazing after him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to make of it. He looked
like a wild man; but that was one of our ponies,
I’ll take my oath on that.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">A STORM AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</p>

<p>Long after dark that same evening the two
lads came limping into camp to the no small relief
of the anxious watchers, who had built a
roaring fire to guide them back. After a fine
supper they told the story of their day’s adventures
which, as may be imagined, caused no
small astonishment among their hearers. The
fact that they had recognized the pony on which
the wild-looking man rode, together with their
description of the man himself, served quite sufficiently
to identify him as the same fellow who
had been seen by Ralph on the two former occasions.
But so far as solving his identity was
concerned, they were as far off as ever.</p>

<p>After a late sleep the next day, a visit was paid
to the hole down which poor White-eye had terminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
his career, thereby causing Harry Ware
and young Simmons so much trouble. The carcass
of the bear lay there, and although tracks
showed that animals&mdash;foxes and wolves in all
probability&mdash;had been sniffing around it, the body
had not been molested. When Mountain Jim had
skinned it, they had a fine “silver tipped” grizzly’s
skin to take back with them.</p>

<p>Harry had remained in camp during this expedition
so as to rest his sprained ankle as much
as possible. Mountain Jim had collected various
herbs and pounded them into a paste which, when
laid on the injured member, did it more good
than all the liniments in the professor’s medicine
chest. But it was still painful, for the exertions
he had made in getting back to camp on the previous
evening had not improved it.</p>

<p>After a consultation it was decided that the
party could not well continue to the bow of the
Columbia River without getting two more ponies
to replace the dead and stolen animals. Mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Jim said that he knew of a ranch not more
than fifteen miles off across the mountains, at
which he could purchase the needed animals
cheaply. It was decided, therefore, that he and
Ralph should leave early the next day for the
ranch and bring back two ponies with them. The
others would have liked to go along; but in view
of the apparent hostility of the mysterious man
it was decided best to leave a strong guard in
camp.</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning the camp
was astir. But Mountain Jim was hardly out of
his blankets before he gave an angry exclamation
and pointed to where the stores had been
piled under a canvas.</p>

<p>The cover had been raised during the night,
and by the disorder that prevailed among the
supplies it was plain that several articles had
been taken. But who or what could have done
the rifling?</p>

<p>Bears were the culprits, according to Mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Jim’s first declaration, but he revised his
opinion when Ralph’s quick eyes detected the
print of a foot in the soft ground near by. A
slight, misty rain had fallen in the night and
the ground showed plainly the impression of a
human foot, or rather of what was, apparently,
a very old and broken pair of boots.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Mountain Jim, “I guess
it’s your friend that’s been and done this, Master
Ralph. Yes, by hooky! there’s the hoof print of
the pony he stole. I’d know it among a dozen.
See here, that off fore shoe is broken.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all the nerve!” gasped Ralph. “To
visit our camp on a thieving expedition mounted
on a stolen pony from our pack train; can you
beat it?”</p>

<p>“You can’t,” chorused the boys.</p>

<p>“Can’t even tie it,” commented Percy Simmons,
standing with his hands in his pockets and
legs far apart, surveying the scene of vandalism.</p>

<p>An investigation showed that some flour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
beans, and a big hunk of bacon had been taken,
besides canned goods.</p>

<p>“Say, I’d like to get my hands on that fellow
for just about five minutes,” declared Mountain
Jim angrily. “The skunk’s broken every law of
the woods. If he had been hungry and asked
for grub he’d have been welcome, but not to
sneak it off this way. I’d just like to get hold of
him.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we notify the Northwest Mounted
Police?” asked the professor mildly.</p>

<p>“There ain’t no station closer than MacLean’s,”
was the reply, “an’ that’s a good sixty
miles off the other way. Besides that, we don’t
go much on police in matters of this kind.”</p>

<p>Mountain Jim’s face took on a grim look. It
was just as well for that mysterious individual
that he was not within reach of those clenched
and knotted fists right then. However, even
with the draught that had been made on their
stock of provisions, they still had a large enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
supply to last them to the Big Bend, where Mountain
Jim assured them they could get anything
they wanted “from a pin to a threshing machine”
at a store kept by a French-Canadian.</p>

<p>However, as they all felt a desire to push onward,
they did not waste much time discussing
the visit of the thief in the night. Instead, Mountain
Jim and Ralph busied themselves with preparations
for their start, and soon after breakfast
they jogged off to an accompaniment of a chorus
of good-wishes and farewells. Their road lay
down the little valley in which they had camped,
and before long an elbow of craggy cliff shut
out the little canvas settlement from view.</p>

<p>The road was level for a short distance and
they made good time, the ponies loping along as
if they enjoyed it. Soon Mountain Jim consulted
his compass and declared that the time had come
for climbing a ridge and making “across country”
for the ranch where he hoped to get the
ponies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, they spurred up a steep mountain
side covered with dark and somber pines and
tamarack, among which the wind sighed dismally.
The going was much the same as Ralph was already
getting accustomed to in that rugged, little-traveled
country. Rocks, fallen trees and deep
crevasses crossed their paths in every direction,
causing frequent detours.</p>

<p>Hour after hour they traveled through this
sort of country, making but slow progress. At
noon they stopped for a bite of lunch, and tethering
the ponies in some scant grass which grew in
a rocky clearing, they seated themselves on a log
for their meal. Their canteens of water came in
refreshingly, for they had not passed any
streams or springs.</p>

<p>So engrossed had they been in making their
way over the difficult country that they had been
traversing, that up to this time they had not paid
any attention to the weather. They now saw that
great black clouds were rolling up beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
snow-covered summits to the northwest of them.</p>

<p>As they ate, the clouds spread out as if a sable
blanket had been drawn across the sky by unseen
hands. Before long the sun was blotted out and
the forest grew unspeakably gloomy.</p>

<p>“Reckon we’re in for a change in the weather,”
said Mountain Jim dryly, looking up.</p>

<p>“It seems that way,” was Ralph’s reply; “it’s
getting as dark as twilight. Hadn’t we better be
getting along?”</p>

<p>Mountain Jim nodded.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get across the bed of the valley
yonder before that hits in,” he said. “It looks
like it’s going to be a hummer, and in that case
the water will rise in the creek bed below, uncommon
sudden.”</p>

<p>They finished their meal hastily and remounted.
Before them lay the steep mountain
side, at the bottom of which was the creek of
which Mountain Jim had spoken. At that time
of year it was probably dry, but if the storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
proved to be a bad one it might fill with great
suddenness, and for a short time be transformed
into a roaring torrent, next to impossible to
cross.</p>

<p>As they rode down the shaly mountain side,
their ponies slipping and sliding and scrambling
desperately to keep a footing, there came a low,
distant rumble of thunder. The sky to the northwest
turned from black to a sort of purplish
green. Through this ugly cloud blanket a shaft
of lightning zipped with a livid glare. The thunder
rolled and rumbled among the mountains, reminding
Ralph of Rip Van Winkle’s experiences
in the far-off Catskills.</p>

<p>“She’ll hit in most almighty quick,” opined
Mountain Jim; “wish we’d brought slickers with
us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind a wetting,” rejoined Ralph
stoutly.</p>

<p>“It’s worse than a wetting you’ll get, if it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
bad; half a drowning is more like it,” grunted
Mountain Jim. “Geddap, Baldy, shake a foot.”</p>

<p>But hasten as they would, before they had
gone more than a few hundred yards further the
rain began to fall in huge globules; drops they
could not be called, they were too large. The
thunder roared closer and a sudden chill struck
into the air. The dark woods were lit up in uncanny
fashion by the blinding blue glare of the
lightning.</p>

<p>Suddenly, there was a flash of brilliant intensity
and simultaneously a ripping crash of thunder,
followed by a sound like some mighty mass
crashing earthward.</p>

<p>“Tree hit yonder,” said Mountain Jim laconically,
“reckon we’d better be looking for shelter.
We came close enough to getting hit in that <i>brulee</i>.”</p>

<p>Ralph agreed with him. But where were they
to go to get from under the lofty trees that invited
the lightning to pass through their columnular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
trunks earthward? Suddenly Mountain
Jim gave a shout:</p>

<p>“There we are yonder. <i>The Hotel de Bothwell</i>,”
he cried with a grin.</p>

<p>Ralph looked and saw a small opening under
some rocks not far distant. It was only a small
cave seemingly, but at least, in case anything in
their vicinity was struck, it would keep them out
of harm’s way.</p>

<p>Amidst incessant flashes of lightning and peals
of thunder they made for the place.</p>

<p>“Have to hitch the ponies outside,” said Mountain
Jim. “Too bad there ain’t room to take ’em
in, too; but it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>However, the space in front of the cave mouth
was fairly open and free from trees, so that it
was not as bad as if they had had to tie their
mounts in the dense forest. In the downpour
the mountaineer and the boy made the terrified
ponies fast, and then made a dash for the dark
mouth of the cave. It appeared to be little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
than a recess formed by the piling of a mass
of huge rocks one on top of another, reminding
one of a giant’s game of blocks. Had the
professor been there, he would have ascribed the
presence of the Titanic rock pile to glacial action;
but to Mountain Jim and Ralph, the place stood
for nothing more than a welcome means of shelter.</p>

<p>They were just about to enter it when a low
moaning groan came from the back of the place
and a huge, tawny body flashed past them, almost
knocking Ralph over.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">PRISONERS!</p>

<p>“W-w-w-what under the canopy was that?”
stammered Ralph as soon as he had recovered
himself somewhat from his surprise.</p>

<p>“Mountain lion, cougar, some calls ’em. Lucky
she didn’t claw you, boy,” responded Mountain
Jim. “If she hadn’t dived off so quick I’d have
shot her. But hullo, what’s that?”</p>

<p>From the back of the cave came a plaintive
sound of mewing, as if there were a litter of
kittens concealed there.</p>

<p>“Young ones, by the Blue Bells of Scotland!”
exclaimed Mountain Jim. “Say, we’re mighty
lucky that the old lioness didn’t attack us.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t she?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p>“Dunno. There’s no accountin’ for the freaks
of wild things. At one time they’d attack a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
battleship, at another time they’ll run like cotton-tails.
But I reckon this old lioness is off looking
for her mate.”</p>

<p>“And they will come back and attack us?”</p>

<p>“That ain’t worryin’ me. We’ve got good
rifles, and cougars are mostly dumb cowards anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I hope these are,” said Ralph fervently, “although
I’d like a shot at one, all right.”</p>

<p>They went to the back of the cave to look at
the kittens. There were four of them, pretty little
fluffy, fawn-colored creatures, whose eyes had
apparently only just opened. They blinked as the
lightning flashed and the thunder roared outside
the cave.</p>

<p>But the two did not bend over the litter of lion
cubs for long. The stench of decaying meat
around the den was terrible. The carcasses of at
least a dozen deer lay there, besides the bones
of smaller creatures.</p>

<p>“The old man goes hunting and brings all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
truck back,” said Mountain Jim as they sought
the front of the cave where the air was fresher.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get one of those cubs and tame it,”
said Ralph.</p>

<p>“What for? He’d get so savage when you
raised him that you couldn’t do much with him
’cept shoot him. Puts me in mind of a fellow
that used to live back of Bear Mountain long
time ago, and trained a grizzly so that he could
ride him. Like to hear the yarn?”</p>

<p>There was a twinkle in Mountain Jim’s eye as
he spoke that warned Ralph to prepare for a
wonderful tale of some sort; but anything would
serve to pass the time, so as Jim drew out his old
brier and lighted up, the boy nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, this here fellow, Abe Brown his name
was, Abe J. Brown, caught this grizzly young
and trained him so as he was most as good as a
saddle horse. Abe and his bear was known all
over the country thereabouts, and was accounted
no common wonder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should think not. Do you mean to say that
this fellow actually rode his bear just like a
horse?”</p>

<p>“The very same identical way&mdash;Wow, what
a flash!&mdash;Well, as I was sayin, Abe, he’d ride this
bear all about, huntin’, fishin’, and all. Well, sir,
one day Abe goes up on the mountain after a
deer. The mountain was a famous place for
grizzlies in them days, and what does Abe do
but ride plumbbango right into the middle of a
convention of sixteen of them that was discussing
bear business.</p>

<p>“Well, Abe and his bear got mixed up right
away, and Abe’s bear got killed in the scrap, being
sort of soft from having been raised a pet.”</p>

<p>“But what happened to Abe?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t no ways what you might call communicative
about what happened in that canyon
on the mountain, Abe wasn’t,” went on Mountain
Jim, fixing Ralph with his eye as if to challenge
any doubt in his story, “but the next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Abe come into Baxter’s cross-roads riding one
of them wild bears, and with sixteen skins, includin’
that of his tame beast, tied on behind. He
was some hunter, Abe was.”</p>

<p>“And some story teller, too,” laughed Ralph.
“Do you believe that, Jim?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t sayin’ no and I ain’t sayin’ yes. I’m
jes’ relatin’ the facts as they was told to me,”
said Jim, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>Ralph had half a mind to tell Mountain Jim
some of the staggering yarns he had heard along
the southwestern border during his experiences
in that country of tall men and tall stories; but
at that instant something happened that quite put
everything else out of his head.</p>

<p>Just above the entrance to the cave there was
a huge rock which appeared, either from constant
frost and thaw or from some other cause, to
have slipped from its position among the other
giant boulders, for it was now perilously poised
just above the small entrance to the cavern. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
boy had noticed this rock when they slipped into
the cave, but with the excitement of the cougar
and the roar and crash of the storm, which was
now at its height, he had quite forgotten it.</p>

<p>He now noticed that all around this rock the
water from the hillside above was pouring in a
perfect torrent. The rain was coming down so
hard that it fairly hissed on the ground as it fell.
Under these conditions the whole steep hillside
was a roaring sheet of water, but just above the
pile of rocks under which they crouched was a
small gully which, of course, attracted more
water than any part of the hillside in the vicinity.</p>

<p>“That water’s coming down in a pretty considerable
waterspout,” remarked Mountain Jim, as
he followed the direction of Ralph’s eyes and noticed
the cascade of rain water that was pouring
like a veil in front of the cave mouth.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jim, and I’ve noticed something else, too.
See that rock up there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, what of it? The water’s coming against
it and it is dividing the cataract so that it doesn’t
splash back in here.”</p>

<p>“Not only that; but it’s doing something else;
something that may make trouble for us.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m certain that I saw the rock move.”</p>

<p>“Great Blue Bells of Scotland, you’re dreamin’,
boy. That rock is as solid as the etarnal hills.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure. I’m sure I saw it quiver a
minute back, when that roll of thunder shook the
ground.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re mistaken, boy. Jumpin’ Jehosophat!
Come back here! Quick!”</p>

<p>Ralph had stepped forward to gaze up at the
big poised rock. As he did so, there had come a
brilliant flash and an earth-shaking peal of thunder.</p>

<p>The ground quivered and shook, and as it did
so the great stone gave a lurch forward. The
next instant it crashed downward right upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
spot where Ralph had been standing. But the
boy had been snatched back by Jim’s muscular
arm.</p>

<p>“Safe! Thank the Lord!” gasped out Mountain
Jim fervently.</p>

<p>“But look at the rock, Jim! It has blocked the
entrance to this place! We’re prisoners!”</p>

<p>It was only too true. The big stone was lodged
in front of the small cave mouth, shutting out
the light and almost excluding the air except for
a small space at the top. To all intents and purposes
they were as much captives as if a jailer
had clanged a steel gate upon them and locked it
securely.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="pch">INDIANS.</p>

<p>“Well, this is a fine fix!”</p>

<p>“About as bad as it could be.”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. But we’ll find a way out
somehow.”</p>

<p>Mountain Jim spoke with his accustomed confidence;
but it was easy to tell by his puckered
brow and anxious eyes that he was by no means
quite so certain of finding a way out of their
unexpected trouble as he would have it appear.</p>

<p>An examination of the rock showed that it
was a huge and heavy boulder that by ill luck
happened almost exactly to fit the opening of the
cave. Only the crack at the top, which was narrow
and irregular admitted light and air.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re in a snug enough place now,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Mountain Jim, with a rueful grin, as he
completed his examination, “the only objection
is that we’re too blamed snug. I could do with
a thinner door, for my part.”</p>

<p>Ralph agreed with him. The boy’s spirits were
considerably dashed by this misfortune which, indeed,
appeared to portend serious, even fatal results
if some way could not be found out of their
quandary.</p>

<p>They tried shoving the great rock, but their
efforts were of no more avail than if they had
been a couple of puny babes.</p>

<p>“That settles that,” grunted Mountain Jim,
wiping the sweat off his face as they concluded
their efforts. “‘No admittance,’ that’s the sign
we ought to have hung outside.”</p>

<p>“‘No exit,’ would be more like it,” retorted
Ralph, “I don’t see why anyone would want to
get in here.”</p>

<p>He spoke sharply and Mountain Jim looked at
him with a quizzical look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now don’t blow up, youngster,” he said,
“things might be a lot worse. For instance, you
might be under that rock at this blessed minute.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! That’s so, and I owe it to you that
I’m not,” spoke Ralph quickly, flushing shame-facedly
over his exhibition of temper.</p>

<p>“That part of it is all right,” responded Mountain
Jim easily, “but the point is that I’ve been in
a heap tighter places than this and got out with
a whole skin. Let’s form ourselves into a Committee
of Ways and Means&mdash;of getting out of
here.”</p>

<p>“All right. You start off. Any suggestions?”</p>

<p>“Yep. I’ve got one right hot off the griddle.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Well, the storm seems to have died down a
bit now, and you can go outside and take a look
and then report back on what you find.”</p>

<p>“But how in the world am I going to get out?”</p>

<p>“See that crack at the top there?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hold on. You never know what a narrow
place you can squeeze through till you try. It’s
my opinion that you can slip through that crack
as easy as a bit of thread through the eye of a
darning needle.”</p>

<p>Ralph eyed the crack between the top of the
stone and the roof of the cave dubiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll try it,” he said, “but first I’ll take off my
coat. That’ll make me thinner.”</p>

<p>He shed his stout hunting jacket and took the
axe out of his belt. Then, aided by Mountain Jim,
he clambered up and looked outside. The storm
was rolling away to the southeast, and before
long, as he could see, the sun would be shining
once more. If only they could get out they could
resume their journey without delay.</p>

<p>As Jim had foretold, it was not a hard matter
for the lithe, slim boy to wriggle through the
crack, narrow as it had appeared to be from below.
Ralph stuck his head through and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
drew the rest of his body up. In a minute he
was on the outside of the cave and free.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jim,” he called back, “can’t you make it,
too?”</p>

<p>“Not me. My two hundred pounds would
never get through that mouse hole,” responded
Jim with perfect good humor. “I guess I’ll have
to stay here till I get thin enough to follow you.”</p>

<p>Ralph slid down the rough face of the rock
and then fell to examining its base eagerly. It
rested on a small terrace just in front of the
cave, but it didn’t take him long to see that no
ordinary means would dislodge it.</p>

<p>“How about you?” shouted Jim from within
his rocky prison.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there’s no hope, Jim,” was the disheartening
reply. “It’s planted as solidly as Gibraltar,
outside here. A giant couldn’t move it.”</p>

<p>“Well, as there’s no giants likely to happen
along, that don’t much matter,” said Jim in his
dry way, from within the cave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“But,” he added, “if we had some giant powder,
that would be a different thing.”</p>

<p>“You mean blasting powder?”</p>

<p>“Yep, ‘giant powder’ is what we call it up
here.”</p>

<p>“If we can’t do anything else, I’d better ride
to some settlement and try to get some.”</p>

<p>“Yes, unless any miner or prospector happens
along and that’s not likely.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“‘Cause this is in the Blood Indians’ reservation
and the Bloods don’t take kindly to strangers
roaming around on their property and hunting
and prospectin’.”</p>

<p>“Are they bad Indians?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly. Just ugly, I reckon ’ud be
about the name fer it. The guv’ment keeps fire
water away from ’em all it can, but they sneak
it in somehow and a Blood with whisky in him is
a bad proposition. They’ll steal ponies, rob
houses, do most anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that I’d mind seeing even
a Blood Indian now,” said Ralph, “in spite of
their ugly name. Maybe they could help us or at
any rate ride for help.”</p>

<p>“Son, a Blood would just as soon shove you
off a cliff if he saw you standing on the edge of
one, as he would tell you you were in danger of
a tumble. But say, get me a drink of water, will
you? I’m as dry as an old crust after shoving at
this bloomin’ rock.”</p>

<p>Ralph went toward the ponies, where the canteens
hung to the saddle horns. But both were
almost empty and as the creek was raging and
roaring not far below him, he determined to go
down to it and refill their water containers.</p>

<p>He found the creek much swollen by the rain,
and racing and tumbling on its boulderous bed
like a miniature torrent. But the water was clear
and cold, and he took a long drink before refilling
the canteens. This done, he pushed his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
among the alders back toward the blocked-up
cave.</p>

<p>All at once, off to the right, he heard the
sound of hoofs and voices.</p>

<p>“Good enough,” thought the lad to himself,
“here’s some one who can give us a hand to get
out of this precious fix we’re in.”</p>

<p>He hurried forward, but the alders were thick
and his hands were occupied so that his progress
was slow. From time to time a whipping-back
branch would slap him a stinging blow across the
face, making it smart painfully.</p>

<p>So it was that he did not emerge into the clearing
until the voices he had heard had grown quite
close. In fact, the appearance of the boy with
the canteens and the emergence of three horsemen
into the clearing were simultaneous. But
as Ralph beheld those horsemen his heart gave a
quick, alarmed bound, and then sank into his
boots.</p>

<p>They were Indians! Evidently they had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
seen the tethered ponies of the white men and
were discussing them with animation.</p>

<p>All three were mounted on wiry ponies. Two
wore blankets and soft hats, with much patched
trousers poking from under the folds of their
gaudy wrappings. The third, who appeared to
be some sort of a superior being, was garbed in
an old frock coat, several sizes too large for him,
and in his soft hat was stuck a long eagle feather,
as if to symbolize his rank.</p>

<p>But in spite of their semi-civilized garb, all
three had cruel, savage faces and eyed the tethered
ponies with gluttonous eyes. As Ralph
watched them, the one with the frock coat drew
out a bottle and handed it in turn to his two
companions.</p>

<p>“They’re Bloods and they’ve got hold of fire-water
some place,” murmured Ralph. “We’re in
for more trouble now, and I left my rifle in the
cave!”</p>

<p>He crouched back among the alders, wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
if Jim was aware of what was going forward
outside the blockaded cave. So far the Indians
had not seen him, and Ralph was not particularly
anxious that they should.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="pch">AN ENCOUNTER WITH “BLOODS.”</p>

<p>The Indians appeared to be in no hurry, and
from the fact that the carcass of a deer lay across
the back of one of their ponies Ralph judged
that they were a hunting party. But the appraising
glances that they cast at the tethered ponies
were by no means reassuring.</p>

<p>They looked about them cautiously for a time,
and exchanged some hasty words in their guttural
dialect. Then the one who wore the odd-looking
frock coat and the eagle feather slipped
from his pony and approached those that were
tied.</p>

<p>It was high time to interfere apparently; but
still Ralph hung back. Unarmed as he was, he
was unwilling to show himself until actual necessity
called for it. But when the frock-coated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Indian deliberately began to unknot the tie ropes
of their ponies his intention was only too plain
and the boy cast all prudence aside.</p>

<p>“Hey, you, let go of that pony!” he exclaimed,
coming out from the shelter of the alders.</p>

<p>The Indian started and turned, and his two
companions did the same. For a minute they
were considerably startled, for “red coats”
(mounted police) occasionally rode through that
part of the country.</p>

<p>But when they saw that it was only a boy who
faced them, they quickly recovered their composure.</p>

<p>“Hullo, white boy,” said the one that appeared
to be the leader, speaking a dialect that cannot be
reproduced on paper. “Hullo, white boy, what
you want, eh?”</p>

<p>“I want you to leave those ponies alone,” spoke
back Ralph boldly, “they belong to me and my
partner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“That so, eh? Well, we take them ’long small
piece, savee?”</p>

<p>The rascal coolly bent over the rope and went
on unfastening it. Ralph was, for a minute, at
a loss what to do. Then he bethought himself
of Jim in the cave.</p>

<p>“Jim! oh, Jim!” he cried shrilly.</p>

<p>“Hullo,” came a hearty voice in reply, “what’s
up?”</p>

<p>“Some rascals are stealing&mdash;&mdash;” began Ralph,
when one of the mounted Bloods slipped swiftly
from his pony and, before the boy could utter an other
syllable, grasped him by the throat. Ralph
was a powerful boy, but in the hands of the wiry,
muscular Blood he was no more than an infant
The man drew an ugly looking knife.</p>

<p>“You keep quiet, eh? Me plentee stickee you,
you make any more chac-chac (talk).”</p>

<p>Whether the Indian would really have carried
out his threat or not Ralph had no means of
guessing, but he deemed it most prudent under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the circumstances to obey. The Indian smelled
most abominably of liquor, and was evidently in
no docile mood. A sort of reckless deviltry
danced in his eyes that warned Ralph not to cross
him.</p>

<p>But the next instant, to his unspeakable relief,
he heard Jim’s voice again.</p>

<p>“I’m trying to climb up the rock. I’ll be there
in a jiffy. Confound it, but it’s slippery!”</p>

<p>Of course Ralph could not reply, but the words
cheered him. If Jim would only appear with his
rifle maybe he could scare the Bloods off. In
an agony of impatience he waited. Luckily the
rain had wetted the knots so that they were hard
to untie and the Blood leader was having a lot
of trouble with them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ralph heard a sharp cry from the
Indian that still remained on horseback. The one
that was bending over the knots heard the exclamation
and glanced up, as did the one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
was threatening Ralph. The boy, too, looked
around and soon saw what had alarmed them.</p>

<p>Creeping into the clearing were two immense,
tawny forms. The female cougar had returned
with her mate!</p>

<p>The Indians gave a series of sharp cries, and
the one that held Ralph released his hold and
ran for his pony. So did the one that had been
bent on stealing the white men’s mounts.</p>

<p>Lashing the ground with their tails the lions
began to give utterance to a sort of whining snarl.</p>

<p>This was answered from within the cave by a
chorus of mewings and squeals from the cubs.
The sound of her young appeared to drive the
lioness to fury. She leaped full at the nearest
Indian, and landed on the haunches of his terrified
pony.</p>

<p>One of the others snatched a rifle from his
saddle and fired at the animal, but before he
could aim properly the male cougar had attacked
him, and the bullet went wild. Evidently the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
lions thought the Indians were responsible for
keeping them from their cubs.</p>

<p>The rifle was an old, single-barrelled one, and
having fired the one shot the Indian had no
chance to reload. But as the bullet sang by her,
the lioness had relaxed her hold on the terrified
pony’s haunches and slipped to the ground to face
this new antagonist. Ralph gazed on with fascinated
horror. The scene was unreal, fantastic
almost. The three Indians, an instant before
bent on thievery, were now fighting for their lives
against two creatures urged to fury by the most
powerful motive known to the animal kingdom&mdash;the
love of their young.</p>

<p>“Cheysoyo tamya!” cried the one with the eagle
feather, and, urging their ponies to mad flight,
the Indians made off at top speed. The lions
made two or three bounds after them, but then
stopped to listen to the appealing cries of the
cubs inside the cave.</p>

<p>They were a badly embarrassed pair of felines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Evidently the manner in which the cave had been
sealed up during their absence was a mystery to
them. They walked about in front of it sniffing,
growling and lashing their tails like gigantic cats
in a rage. Dangerous as his position was, Ralph
could not but admire the restless grace of the
tawny creatures with their smooth, yellowish
coats and great green savage eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, and without any particular reason
that Ralph could see, although they had undoubtedly
smelled him, the two cougars came
bounding toward the alder thicket into which he
had crouched back when first they appeared.
Ralph’s heart almost stopped beating as they
came. He looked toward the cave despairingly.</p>

<p>As he gazed he saw Jim’s rugged face appear
in the crack above the rock. The mountaineer
took in the scene instantly, and, although he could
not see Ralph, he called to him.</p>

<p>“Come on the rock, boy! I’ll hold them back.”</p>

<p>Ralph saw the muzzle of Jim’s rifle gleam in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the afternoon sun as he thrust it through the
crack and sighted with his keen eyes along the
barrel.</p>

<p>Instantly his mind was made up as to what
he would do. As the lions dived into the alders
not far from him he dashed out and made for
the rock. In the meantime the tethered ponies
were plunging and rearing as if they would break
their ropes. But the lions paid no attention to
them. Apparently they were only seeking those
who had invaded their den.</p>

<p>As Ralph made his dart for safety the lions
spied him. With crashing bounds they came out
of the underbrush.</p>

<p>Ralph felt a bullet whiz by his ear, but he
heard no howl to tell that one of the lions had
been hit. Instead, came Jim’s voice from above.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord! This plagued rock juts out too far
for me to aim down on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Throw me down the rifle, quick!” cried Ralph,
an agony in his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew he could not clamber up the rock in
time to avoid the lions’ claws. His one chance
lay in the desperate plan he had formed as Jim’s
exclamation came to his ears.</p>

<p>Jim let the rifle come sliding and clattering
down the rock and Ralph caught it up. The
strange noise of the weapon as it came to the
ground after the startling report halted the lions
for an instant. But as he turned to face them
Ralph saw that they were all ready for another
attack.</p>

<p>He bravely prepared to meet it, although his
pulses throbbed and his breath came so fast that
he could hardly hold the rifle in the proper position.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">FIGHTING MOUNTAIN LIONS.</p>

<p>“Steady, boy! Steady!” came Jim’s voice
from above, vibrant with agitation.</p>

<p>He knew only too well that to the tyro at big
game shooting any large animal appears about
twice as large and ferocious as it really is. Many
lives have been lost and many painful and disfiguring
wounds carried to the grave because a
man’s nerve has failed him at the critical moment
when hunting dangerous game.</p>

<p>“You’re only shootin’ at a mark, boy! That’s
all! Hold on ’em now! Hold on ’em!”</p>

<p>Jim’s voice steadied Ralph’s nerves wonderfully.
He glanced down the rifle barrel and then,
as his finger pressed the trigger the report roared
and crashed through the valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give it to ‘em! Oh, give it to ‘em!” yelled
Jim wildly.</p>

<p>Following the two sharp, quick reports and
mingling with them came a scream full of
ferocious agony. Ralph saw a big, tawny body
leap high into the air and then, falling back, begin
to claw the earth and stones frantically.</p>

<p>“Look out for the other!” roared Jim, and none
too soon, for the female, seeing that her mate was
stricken by the brave boy’s shot, now prepared
to spring.</p>

<p>Ralph’s attention had been distracted from
her by the death agonies of the male cougar.
Jim’s warning shout recalled the boy to himself.</p>

<p>He fired once more, but this time he did not
inflict a mortal wound. Instead, his bullet
pierced the lion’s shoulder. Apparently she did
not care for any more of that sort of punishment,
for with a yelp and a howl she turned and dashed
off, leaving her mate stark in death on the ground
in front of the cave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Ralph, white and shaking, now that it was all
over, reeled for a minute and then leaned against
the rock to recover himself a little.</p>

<p>“Bravely done, lad!” came a voice from above.</p>

<p>It was Jim, but Ralph felt almost too weak
from the ordeal he had just passed through to
answer.</p>

<p>“The rifle just seemed to go off by itself,” he
stammered. “I was so scared I couldn’t see anything
plainly.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. You did the trick, and
that’s what counts. Wish you’d got both of ’em,
though. That lioness wasn’t badly hurt and she’ll
be back for her young ones before long.”</p>

<p>“Well, she can’t get into the cave,” said Ralph
with a rather shaky laugh, “any more than you
can get out,” he added ruefully.</p>

<p>“That’s so. I declare for a minute I’d forgotten
all about our fix. Say, but those lions
served us one good turn when they drove off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
those Bloods. The fellows were ugly and meant
trouble.”</p>

<p>“But won’t they be back?”</p>

<p>“Not they. They’ve had time to think it over
by this time, and they’ll have come to realize that
these ain’t early days, and that horse stealing
would result in their whole reservation being
turned inside out till the culprits were found.”</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Ralph suddenly, “somebody’s
coming now. Maybe it <i>is</i> those Indians coming
back, after all.”</p>

<p>“Great Blue Bells of Scotland, it’s someone on
a horse, sure enough. I’ll duck down into the
cave and get your rifle up.”</p>

<p>For it was Jim’s “Old Trusty,” as he called
it, with which Ralph had despatched one lion and
wounded the other.</p>

<p>But to Ralph’s unspeakable relief it was no
band of Bloods that rode into the clearing, but
a bearded man on a wild, shaggy pony leading
a pack mule by a hair rope. From the pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Ralph could see shovel and pick handles sticking
out and both rider and animals appeared to have
been roughing it for many months.</p>

<p>The man wore rough buckskin garments, and
his stirrups were made of rope. On his head was
a battered old Stetson hat with a leather band
around it. Across his saddle bow he carried a
long-barrelled rifle, with the stock embossed with
silver. He glanced at Ralph in a quick, surprised
sort of way.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, what in the ’tarnal’s bin goin’ on
here?” he demanded in a nasal tone, which Ralph
recognized as belonging to a native of the States.</p>

<p>“Why, I&mdash;that is, we’ve been mixed up in a
sort of scrap with Indians and lions,” replied
Ralph hesitatingly.</p>

<p>The man looked so wild and uncouth that he
did not know but he might have to deal with a
highwayman of some sort.</p>

<p>“Do tell,” exclaimed the rough-looking
stranger, “and you’re only a kid, too! Yankee?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Ralph nodded. Just then Jim reappeared at the
crack on the top of the fallen rock, and as his
eyes fell on the stranger he uttered a yell of
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Great Blue Bells of Scotland,” he shouted,
“it’s Bitter Creek Jones!”</p>

<p>“That’s me,” rejoined the stranger shifting in
his saddle, “but who may you be? Come out and
show yourself.”</p>

<p>“I can’t. My door is locked on the outside,
so to speak; but I’m Mountain Jim Bothwell&mdash;remember
me?”</p>

<p>The stranger broke into a great roar of delight.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, do tell. If this ain’t luck. Mountain
Jim! I ain’t never forgot that day on the Bow
River that you saved me from that bunch of
huskies that was goin’ to hold me up and take
my dust away frum me. But come on out. Let’s
shake your paw, old pal!”</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I’m not receiving to-day,” responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Mountain Jim. He hastened on to explain
what had happened within the last few
hours, interrupted constantly by Bitter Creek
Jones’ astonished exclamations.</p>

<p>“I heard an almighty firin’ an’ blazin’ away
frum over this neck of the woods,” he said, “and
I jes’ nacherally come over ter see what in Sam
Hill was goin’ forward. So ye’re all walled up,
hey? Jes’ wait a jiffy while I take a look at that
rock. It’ll be tough luck if Bitter Creek can’t
get you out’n that mouse-trap without’n you
havin’ ter ride fifty miles fer help.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can do anything, Mr.
Jones?” asked Ralph, as the odd-looking stranger
slipped off his sorry-appearing steed.</p>

<p>“Say, Sonny, I’m plain Bitter Crik to my
friends. I’m Mister Jones to them that don’t like
me, see? So far as gittin’ Mountain Jim out’n
that hole, it’ll be hard luck if I kain’t do it. Bitter
Crik’s got gold out’n tougher places nor that, you
kin bet your last red. Lucky I came along this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
way, too. You see I’ve bin prospectin’ all through
here, but it’s a rotten country. I’m going back
to the States and ship to Alasky, when I git out’n
the Rockies.”</p>

<p>Talking thus, Bitter Creek, who looked so
ferocious, but proved so good-natured, examined
the rock from all sides. As he carried on his investigations
he hummed to himself like a man
in deep thought.</p>

<p>At length he straightened up and hailed Jim.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you out’n here, Jim,” he said.</p>

<p>“All right, old man, wish you would. These
cubs smell like a shoe factory on fire. I ain’t
particular, but I know a heap of smells that’s
sweeter, including skunk.”</p>

<p>Bitter Creek turned to Ralph.</p>

<p>“Know what I’m goin’ ter do, Sonny?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Ralph shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, see here. That rock rests on this little
terrace or ledge, don’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And the ground all slopes away from it
toward the creek?”</p>

<p>“It does,” rejoined Ralph, seeing that the odd
man expected some sort of a reply.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to put a slug of giant powder
in under that terrace and blow it out from under
the rock. Onless I mistake my guess, that’s all
that’s holdin’ it. When we blow that to Kingdom
Come that ol’ rock is jes’ nacherally goin’ ter
start rollin’ down ther hill, and out ’ull walk Jim
as large as life and twice as nacheral.”</p>

<p>“But won’t the explosion hurt him?” asked
Ralph, to whom this appeared to be a dangerous
proceeding.</p>

<p>“May shake him up a bit, but yer see, the force
of giant powder works downward, and I’ll drive
in under the rock for the shot.”</p>

<p>The scheme was explained to Mountain Jim,
who entirely acquiesced in it. Bitter Creek
Jones wasted no more time, but hurried off to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
mule. From the pack he produced a small box
carefully wrapped in various soft cloths. This
proved to be filled with excelsior, amidst which
nestled sticks of giant powder. From another
box came caps and fuse.</p>

<p>Then with a crowbar, the miner drove a deep
hole under the terrace on which the rock rested,
and this done, capped and fused two sticks of
dynamite and “tamped” them into place. Then
summoning Ralph they both retreated to a distance,
and Bitter Creek bent over and lit the fuse.</p>

<p>“Look out, Jim!” he yelled as it sputtered and
sparked. “In about tew minutes there’s goin’ ter
be ‘Hail Columbia’ round these diggin’s.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">“BITTER CREEK JONES.”</p>

<p>A dull, booming crash that shook the ground
under their feet, followed within a few seconds.
A cloud of dust and rocks arose from the cave
mouth. Suddenly Ralph broke into a shout:</p>

<p>“The rock! The rock! It’s moving!”</p>

<p>“Hold on, boy,” warned the prospector, laying
a hand on Ralph’s shoulder. “Watch!”</p>

<p>The big boulder hesitated, swayed, and then,
with a reverberating crash, as the blasted terrace
under it gave way, it rolled down the hillside.
An instant after, Jim Bothwell burst from the
cavern and ran toward them. It was all that
Ralph, in his joy, could do to keep from embracing
him, but just then a sudden shout from Bitter
Creek Jones caught and distracted his attention.
In their excitement they had forgotten all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the tethered ponies. The great rock was now
bounding toward them with great velocity.</p>

<p>It shook the ground as its ponderous weight
rumbled down the hillside. The ponies whinnied
with terror and tugged and strained at their
ropes. But just as it appeared inevitable that
they must be crushed, the huge rock struck a
smaller one and its course was diverted. Down
it went, but on a safe track now, and terminated
its career in the clump of thick growing alders
that fringed the stream.</p>

<p>“Wow, a narrow escape!” ejaculated Ralph
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Yep, we come pretty durn near killin’ two
birds&mdash;or ponies, rayther&mdash;with one stone,”
grinned Bitter Creek Jones; “but all’s well as
turns out all right, as the poet says.”</p>

<p>“Bitter, you’re all right,” cried Jim, clutching
the hand of the prospector who had turned up so
opportunely.</p>

<p>“Shucks! That’s all right, Jim. It wasn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
much to do fer you, old pal,” responded Bitter
returning the pressure. “And now,” he went on,
as if anxious to change the subject, “you’d better
skin that lion and be gettin’ on yer way. It’s
drawin’ in late, and this is a bad part of the
country to get benighted in, more specially with
a bunch of Bloods hanging about all lit up with
fire-water.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you’re right, Bitter,” was the response
as Mountain Jim deftly made the necessary incisions
and he and his friend skinned the dead
cougar with skillful hands.</p>

<p>It was not long after that they parted company.
Bitter Creek Jones continuing toward the south,
while Ralph and Mountain Jim swung on to their
ponies and resumed their journey toward the
northwest. The last they saw of Bitter Creek
Jones he was waving a hearty adieu to them and
shouting:</p>

<p>“See you in Alaska north of fifty-three, some
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Then a shoulder of mountain shut him out and
they saw him no more.</p>

<p>“There’s a white man,” said Jim with deep conviction,
as the ponies carried them from the scene.
“He’s rough as a bear, is Bitter, but white right
down to his gizzard.”</p>

<p>Ralph regretted that he could not have taken
one of the cubs along, but on the rough trip
that still lay before them it would have been extremely
difficult if not impossible to transport it.
So the little den of young cougars had to be left
behind to await the return of their wounded
mother, an event which, Mountain Jim declared,
would take place within a short time.</p>

<p>“Maybe I ought to have killed the whole boiling
of them young termagents,” he said. “They’ll
grow up and make a heap of trouble for sheepmen,
but let ’em be. I ain’t got the heart to
make away with a lot of babies like them.”</p>

<p>It was dark when, on topping a backbone of
desolate mountain, they saw in a valley below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
them a light shining amidst the blackness. Jim
declared that this must be the ranch for which
they were searching, and they made their best
speed toward the lonely beacon. If it had been
hard traveling by daylight through the forest, it
was doubly difficult to make their way by night.
But Jim appeared to possess in a superlative degree
that wonderful sense of location peculiar to
persons who have passed their lives in the great
silent places of the earth. It has been noted by
travelers that a young Indian boy, who has apparently
not noted in the slightest the course
followed on a hunting expedition into the great
woods, has been able, without any apparent mental
effort, to guide back to camp the party of
which he formed a member. Such a faculty has
been ascribed as more due to instinct, the sense
that brings a carrier pigeon home over unknown
leagues, than to anything else.</p>

<p>Through the darkness they blundered on,
through muskegs, fallen timber and swollen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
creeks&mdash;the latter due to the heavy rains of the
afternoon. At length, after it appeared to Ralph
almost certain that they must have lost their way,
they came out on a plateau and saw shining not
half a mile from them the light for which Mountain
Jim had been aiming.</p>

<p>A sea captain, with all the resources of highly
perfected instruments, could not have made a
more successful land-fall. But as they drew
nearer to the light, a puzzled expression could
have been observed on Mountain Jim’s face had
it been clearly visible. Ralph, too, soon became
aware of a great noise of shouting and singing
proceeding from the vicinity of the light.</p>

<p>“Must have some sort of a party going on,”
he observed to his companion.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” was Mountain Jim’s rejoinder.
“Donald Campbell used to be a bachelor and no
great shakes for company. Maybe he’s married
and they’re havin’ a pink tea or something.”</p>

<p>Soon after, they rode up to a rough looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
house, behind which, bulking blackly against the
darkness, were the outlines of haystacks. Several
horses were hitched in front of the place and the
door was open, emitting a ruddy stream of light
that fell full on one of the animals. Ralph recognized
the cayuse with a start. It was one of
those that had been ridden by the Bloods. There
was no mistaking the animal’s pie-bald coat and
wall-eye. He was what is known among cowmen
as a “paint-horse.”</p>

<p>Ralph gasped out his information to Mountain
Jim. His companion only nodded.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking for some time that there
is something queer about this place,” he said, “but
there’s no help for it, we’ve got to see it through
now.”</p>

<p>And then a minute later he made an odd inquiry:</p>

<p>“Where’ve you got the money for the ponies,
Ralph?”</p>

<p>“Right in my inside coat pocket. Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I dunno. Better put it in a safer place;
you might lose it.”</p>

<p>Ralph could not quite understand the drift of
his companion’s remark, but he shifted the money&mdash;one
hundred dollars in bills&mdash;to his belt, which
had a money pocket for such purposes. By this
time they were up to the long hitching post where
the other ponies were tied and they dismounted
and secured their own animals.</p>

<p>“Let me do the talking,” warned Mountain
Jim as they approached the door. The noise of
their arrival had been noticed within, and a short,
stocky figure of a man with a flaming red beard
blocked the light from the doorway as they approached.</p>

<p>“Great Blue Bells of Scotland, that ain’t
Donald Campbell, by a long shot!”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s moved on,” said Ralph, recollecting
the phrasing of the notice in the deserted log
cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe,” responded Jim briefly. The next
minute the man in the doorway hailed them.</p>

<p>“Evening, strangers.”</p>

<p>“Evening,” responded Jim. “Donald Campbell
about?”</p>

<p>“Naw. He ain’t lived here in quite a spell.
Gone up the valley ten miles or more. Lookin’
for him?”</p>

<p>“Well, I calculated on seeing him,” was Jim’s
response. “Can we stay here to-night?”</p>

<p>The man hesitated an instant, but then spoke
swiftly as if to cover up his momentary vacillation.</p>

<p>“Yep. Come right in. Guess we kin get you
supper and a shake-down. That’s all you want,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” responded Jim as they passed the
threshold. Inside they found themselves in a
rough looking room lighted by a hanging lamp
which reeked of kerosene. At a table under it
some men had been sitting, but they vanished with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
what appeared suspicious haste as the two
strangers came in. The host left them alone soon
after, promising to give them some bacon and
eggs and coffee. The noise that they had heard
as they drew close to the ranch had died out, and
now all was as silent as a graveyard. Ralph
lowered his voice as he addressed Mountain Jim.</p>

<p>“What sort of a place is this, anyhow?”</p>

<p>In the same low tones Jim made his reply:</p>

<p>“Dunno, but it looks to me like what they call
up in this section a ‘whisky ranch.’ It’s the resort
of bad characters and is stuck back here in the
woods so as to be beyond the ten-mile limit. You
see the Canadian government, knowing what
harm that stuff does, won’t let liquor be sold
within ten miles of a public roadway.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s what brought those Indians
here?”</p>

<p>“Looks that way. But this fellow would be
in mighty bad if it was found out by the mounted
police. But&mdash;hush! I reckon he’s coming now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Sure enough the red-bearded man re-entered
the room at this juncture. He bore a big dish
of bacon and eggs in one hand and in the other
he had a blackened tin pot from which came the
savory aroma of coffee.</p>

<p>From a corner cupboard he got tin plates and
cups and wooden-handled knives and forks. He
asked them what their business was as he laid the
table, which required no cloth, being covered with
a strip of white oil-cloth.</p>

<p>“We wanted to buy some ponies from Donald
Campbell,” spoke Ralph before Jim’s heavy foot
kicked him under the table. For an instant there
was a sharp glint in the red-bearded man’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Buyin’ ponies, eh? Must have lots of money.
Ponies is high right now.”</p>

<p>“In that case we can’t afford ’em,” said Jim,
taking the conversation into his own hands. He
had noticed the momentary flash in the man’s
eyes when Ralph spoke of buying ponies, and
rightly interpreted it. The man stood by them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
while they ate and told them that he had bought
the ranch some time before, but that it was a
poor place and he could make nothing out of it
He appeared anxious to impress them that he
was a rancher and nothing else, and spoke much
of crops and stock. Jim and Ralph listened, replying
at intervals.</p>

<p>When they had finished eating, the red-bearded
man offered to escort them to bed. He wanted
to put them in separate rooms, but Mountain Jim
demurred to this.</p>

<p>“My partner here is a heavy sleeper,” he said,
“and we’ve got to be up early to-morrow. I’d
rouse up the whole house waking him if you put
him in another room.”</p>

<p>“All right, I can put you in the attic,” said
the man, “but you’ll not be over comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Jim airily. “We’re
used to roughing it.”</p>

<p>“You may be, but your partner don’t look over
and above husky,” said the red-bearded man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
glancing at Ralph’s slender form, which rather
belied the boy’s real strength and activity. He
conducted them upstairs and left them in an unceiled
attic in which were two rough cots. He
took the lamp with him when he went, saying
that it was too dangerous to leave a kerosene
lamp up there so close to the rafters.</p>

<p>“Don’t sleep too sound,” whispered Jim as they
got into their cots. “I’ve a notion that our friend
with the vermilion chin coverings isn’t any better
than he ought to be. I’m sorry you made that
crack about buying ponies; it’s given him the
idea that we are carrying a lot of money. I saw
it in his eyes as soon as he spoke.”</p>

<p>Ralph hadn’t much to say to this. He realized
that he had made a bad mistake and blamed himself
bitterly. But he determined to try to retrieve
his error by keeping awake to watch for
any sudden alarm. But try as he would, his exhausted
eyelids drooped as if weighted with lead,
and before long, tired nature had asserted her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
sway and the lad was sound asleep on his rough
couch.</p>

<p>Just what hour it was Ralph could not determine,
but he was suddenly awakened by a noise
as if someone had pushed a chair across the
room or had stumbled on it. Broad awake in
an instant he sat up in the cot, his every sense
alert and his heart throbbing violently.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE OUTLAW RANCH.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was conscious that someone was
near his cot. He could hear hard breathing and
then he felt a hand creeping over the covers. In
a flash he grasped it and yelled aloud to Mountain
Jim. Now Jim, no less tired than Ralph, had
likewise dropped off to sleep despite his determined
efforts to keep awake. But Ralph’s cry
brought him out of his cot in a bound.</p>

<p>“Great Blue Bells of Scotland! What’s up?”
he roared.</p>

<p>“There’s someone trying to rob me!” yelled
Ralph, still clutching the wrist he had caught.
The next instant a hand was at his throat and a
knee on his chest and he was choked into silence.
But his cry had had its effect. Like a runaway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
steer Mountain Jim came charging through the
darkness.</p>

<p>“Who in creation are you, you scallywag?
What do you want?” he roared, grabbing hold of
Ralph’s antagonist, for by good luck he had come
straight in the direction of Ralph’s cry. Without
giving whoever the midnight intruder was any
chance to reply, Mountain Jim encircled him with
his iron arm and hurled him clear across the
room. They could hear a crash and grunt as
the fellow fetched up, and then a rush of feet
through the darkness followed by the crash of
a heavy fall, caused apparently by a violent tumble
down the steep stairs leading to the attic.</p>

<p>They listened intently and heard somebody
picking himself up and limping off.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” exclaimed
Mountain Jim. “Serves me right for sleeping,
though, Ralph. Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, but I feel half choked. That fellow
had a half Nelson on my neck, all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess I had a whole one on his,” chuckled
Jim. “Strike a match, Ralph, and let’s see what
we can see.”</p>

<p>The match showed a revolver lying on the floor
by Ralph’s bed apparently just as it had been
dropped by the intruder when Jim’s mighty arm
encircled him.</p>

<p>“Humph! pretty good gun,” commented Jim
dryly, looking the weapon over. “I’ll bet a doughnut
that the owner never sees it again, though.”</p>

<p>“Who do you think it was?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p>“Old red-whiskers. We’ll look him over in the
morning, and by that same token it’s pretty near
dawn now. Hear the roosters? Well, as there’s
no more sleep for us to-night, we might as well
get up and see to the ponies. It would be just
like this outfit of scallywags to try to do them
some harm or even steal ’em, if your friends, the
Bloods, are about.”</p>

<p>But the ponies, which had been turned into a
corral the night previous, were found to be all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
right, and by the time the stars paled they had
them saddled and re-entered the house. Jim
banged loudly on the table of the room where
they had had supper the previous night and demanded
breakfast. Before long the landlord
came shuffling into the room.</p>

<p>In the pale light they could see that under his
left eye he had a big purple swelling. His hands
shook, too, and altogether he appeared to be very
ill at ease.</p>

<p>“How’d you sleep?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Fine,” rejoined Jim heartily. “In the night a
mosquito or some other kind of low down critter
bothered me, but I guess I bunged him up tolerably
considerable.”</p>

<p>He looked at the red-bearded man with a cheerful
grin, and stared him straight in the eyes. The
optics of the rascal dropped. He got breakfast
in sullen silence and took his pay without a word.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way,” Jim shouted back to him
as they rode off, “I found a gun in that attic last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
night. If the owner wants it, tell him to come
to me, will you?”</p>

<p>The landlord looked at them for an instant and
his florid skin turned green. He swung on his
heel and fairly fled into the house.</p>

<p>“I’ll turn it over to the Mounted Police,”
shouted Jim after him. “I guess they’ll be interested
in finding the owner.”</p>

<p>They arrived at Donald Campbell’s new ranch
shortly afterward, riding over a fairly good road.
The old Scotchman told them that they were
lucky that nothing worse had happened to them.
The place was suspected to be a “whisky ranch,”
and its owner had been in trouble with the police
on two or three occasions.</p>

<p>“I guess he’ll be careful who he tackles next
time,” remarked Jim with a grin.</p>

<p>The bargain for two tough, hard-looking
ponies, broken to pack, was soon struck, and with
good wishes from the old Scotchman they rode
off. They reached the camp on the return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
journey that night, and all hands sat up late
listening with absorbed interest to the story of
their adventures.</p>

<p>The new ponies proved to be anything but
tractable the next morning, but eventually they
were subdued and their packs firmly “diamonded”
to their plunging backs. This done, the way lay
clear before the adventurers to the Big Bend of
the Columbia River. Mountain Jim had told the
boys that their route would skirt the bases of
some of the peaks covered with eternal snow,
among which the great white Rocky Mountain
goat ranges. There might even be a chance, he
declared, for a sight of the famous Big Horn
sheep, although these animals are now so wild
as to be almost inaccessible to hunters.</p>

<p>They set out in high humor, the new ponies
being hitched to more sedate companions so as
to keep their spirits within bounds. But notwithstanding
this, the lively little animals plunged
and leaped about till it appeared as if their packs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
would come off. Throughout the morning they
progressed steadily toward the great snow-covered
peaks that shone and glittered like
diadems toward the northwest. Black ridges of
rock appeared among the white coverings of
their flanks, giving them an odd, striped appearance.</p>

<p>A stop was made for dinner at the side of a
roaring torrent, whose green, cold waters came
from the snow-capped peaks toward which their
way now lay. While Jim cooked the meal, aided
by Jimmie, the boys scattered in every direction
gathering firewood or looking at the scenes about
them. All at once there came a wild whoop of
dismay from Persimmons, who had been entrusted
with the duty of tethering Topsy, one of
the new ponies.</p>

<p>The little animal had taken fright at the smell
of the lion skin, which was rolled up on Baldy’s
back, and before anyone could stop her she was
off toward the torrent. Ralph was in his saddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in a second and after her, swinging his lasso in
true cowboy fashion.</p>

<p>“Yip! yip!” he yelled, delighted at the prospect
of a brisk chase.</p>

<p>But Topsy, although she hesitated a minute on
the brink of the torrent, did not, as Ralph had
surmised, turn and dash along the bank. Instead,
she plunged right into the seething waters, pack
and all, and struck out for the opposite shore.</p>

<p>Ralph only paused a minute and then he was
into the stream after her, urging his unwilling
pony into the cold water. Reaching the middle
of the stream, he slipped off his pony and swam
beside him till shallower water was reached.</p>

<p>The swift current carried them down stream
for quite a distance, but at last the struggling
pony’s feet found solid bottom, and he scrambled
out not more than a hundred yards behind Topsy.
All this had happened so quickly that those left
behind had hardly time to realize it before Ralph
gained the opposite shore. Then Jim hailed him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can you get her, Ralph?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” hailed back the boy positively, and
clapping his big, blunt-rowelled spurs to his pony
he was off into the woods after the fleeing pack
animal. The wood proved to be only a strip
of pine and tamaracks, and beyond was a rocky
ledge leading up the side of a high mountain, for
by this time they had reached the heart of the
Rockies and big peaks towered all about them.</p>

<p>“Yip! yip!” cried Ralph entering fully into the
spirit of the chase. As for Topsy, apparently not
feeling the weight of the heavy pack at all, she
dashed on like a lightning express. Ralph was
sorry that the chase was not among the trees,
for in the timber Topsy would have found it hard
to get along so quickly with the encumbering
pack on her back. But up the rocky ledge, which
zig-zagged like a trail up the mountain, she fairly
flew. The noise of her speeding hoofs was like
that of castanets.</p>

<p>“Well, a stern chase is always a long one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>”
thought Ralph, as he shook a kink out of his
rope and spurred after her as fast as his pony
was capable of going. The camp was soon left
far behind and still the boy found himself on a
narrow trail, or shelf of rock, that inclined steeply
up the mountain side. Below him the ground
dropped off to unknown depths, and on his other
hand a wall of rock shot up so steeply that hardly
a tree or a bush found footing on it. As they
rose higher Ralph experienced a sensation as if
he was riding into cloudland. Frequently he
would lose sight of Topsy, and then again he
could glimpse her as she darted around a shoulder
of the mountain, only to be lost to view again.</p>

<p>“Gracious, this is like being slung up between
heaven and earth,” thought Ralph, as he loped
up the trail as fast as his pony could carry him.
Glancing down he saw that a sort of blue mist
veiled the depths of the abyss below him. He
was many feet above the tops of the tallest of
the big pines. Afar off, through the crisp, clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
air, he could see more ridges, but he appeared
far above them. To anyone gazing at him from
below, the boy would have looked no larger than
a fly on some steep and lofty wall.</p>

<p>“Fine place to meet anything,” he said to himself.
“This road was only built for one.”</p>

<p>At the same instant another thought flashed
across him. Up to this time, in the heat of the
chase, he had cast reflection to the winds.</p>

<p>The trail was narrowing. Unless it widened
further up, how was he to turn his pony around
and retrace his steps?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">CARTHEW OF “THE MOUNTED.”</p>

<p>This thought had hardly occurred to him when
he was saved further pondering by the sight of
Topsy coming flying back along the ledge. Her
nostrils were distended in a frightened way and
her coat was flecked with foam. For a flash he
saw her as she turned a shoulder of rock, and then
she vanished again as the trail turned inward
toward the cliff face. Ralph had only a second
in which to act.</p>

<p>He glanced about him. It appeared impossible
that two ponies could pass on the narrow trail.
Yet he would have to let Topsy get by or else be
backed off into the depths below. In emergencies
such as the boy now faced, the mind usually rises
to the occasion and works with the rapidity necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to dictate quick action. It was so in Ralph’s
case.</p>

<p>He swung his pony in toward the cliff face,
clinging to it closely, as the only possible salvation.
In a flash Topsy came swinging around the
turn, going at full gallop. Ralph held his breath
as he felt her sides graze his right knee! But
she galloped safely by with hardly a fraction of
an inch to spare between her hoofs and the edge
of the trail!</p>

<p>To his huge joy and relief the emergency was
passed, and without accident. In another minute
he had swung his pony around, its small, nimble
legs bunched together to make the turn, and was
off down the trail after the runaway. Almost at
the bottom several riders were advancing toward
the boy. The recreant Topsy was between him
and the newcomers, whom Ralph recognized as
his camp mates. Mountain Jim was at their head
and they had set out in search of Ralph a short
time before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Topsy, thus hemmed in, allowed herself to be
captured without making much resistance, and
a much chastened pony was led back into camp,
where the professor was awaiting the return of
the party.</p>

<p>“Lucky thing that she turned,” was Ralph’s
comment, “for I don’t think that ledge went much
further up the mountain side.”</p>

<p>“Reckon it didn’t,” was Jim’s reply, “and if
you had found a spot where it was much narrower,
you’d have been in an ugly fix.”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” commented Ralph as he
thought of his feelings when he was uncertain
whether Topsy would be able to pass him or not.</p>

<p>As to what had turned the runaway pony in
such a fortunate manner, opinions were divided.
Mountain Jim inclined to the belief that the trail
had come to an end and that the pony had had
sense enough to turn. Ralph, with the recollection
of the animal’s terror fresh in his mind, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
positive that some wild beast had scared the
recreant Topsy and caused her to dash back.</p>

<p>The discussion over the exciting incident had
hardly ceased, when hoof beats were heard coming
along the trail by which they had arrived at
their camping place. All looked up with interest,
for travelers were few in that wild part of the
Rockies. Their curiosity was not long in being
gratified.</p>

<p>Through the trees came riding a stalwart figure
on a big bay horse. The newcomer was clean
shaven, bronzed and capable looking. He wore a
big sombrero, riding boots, and trousers with a
stripe down the sides. His appearance, for he
carried a carbine in a holster and pistols in his
belt, was somewhat alarming to the boys, who
exchanged hurried whispers. But Mountain Jim
soon quieted their fears.</p>

<p>“It’s a trooper of the Northwest Mounted
Police,” he exclaimed, and then, as the rider drew
nearer, he cried out in a glad voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“Great Blue Bells of Scotland, if it ain’t Harry
Carthew!”</p>

<p>“By Jove! Jim Bothwell!” cried the new arrival
in a gratified tone. “Upon my word, I’m
glad to see you. But what brings you here?”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he gazed with some curiosity
about the camp and at the youthful faces of the
young adventurers.</p>

<p>“Sort of piloting these lads and Professor
Wintergreen through the Rockies, Harry,” was
the rejoinder. “Where are you mushing along
to?”</p>

<p>“I’m bound for Muskeg Lake,” was the response,
“just coming through from Fort
Grainger.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you rest here a while?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind if I do,” said the big trooper.
“The goin’s been rough and both I and Dandy
here”&mdash;he patted his horse&mdash;“are a bit fagged,
don’t you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sit down and have a bite to eat,” said Jim
hospitably. “I guess Dandy can shift for himself
all right.”</p>

<p>The trooper unsaddled his mount and was soon
seated in the shade of a big tree, his back against
its trunk, while he dispatched with gusto the food
Jim placed before him. When he had finished,
he and Jim lit their pipes and began to talk, while
the boys and the professor listened interestedly.
The man was a new type to them. Self-reliant,
big-limbed, clear-eyed, and active as a cat in all
his movements, he appeared a fit person for the
hard and often dangerous work of the famous
Northwest Mounted.</p>

<p>He and Jim, it seemed, were old friends, the
veteran guide having aided him in the years past
to corner and make prisoners of a band of cattle
rustlers. Jim told him about their experiences at
the outlaw ranch and the trooper promised to report
the matter to his superior officers at once.</p>

<p>“That red-bearded fellow is a character we’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
been after for a long time,” he said, “and thanks
to you, I guess we’ll be able to round him up
at last. Nevins of Ours almost had him once
years ago, but he slipped through his fingers.”</p>

<p>“What became of Nevins?” asked Jim interestedly.
“That man always made me wonder
what a chap like him wanted to join the Northwest
for.”</p>

<p>Trooper Carthew drew thoughtfully on his
pipe. Then after a minute he looked up and
spoke softly.</p>

<p>“Nevins has gone on a trail he won’t come back
from, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>“How’d it happen?”</p>

<p>“What kills a lot of unseasoned men in the
service: snow madness!” was the rejoinder.
“It’s a thing I don’t often talk about, but if any
of your young men here,” he nodded toward the
boys, “think that life in the Northwest Mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
is any cinch it might be a good thing to tell ’em
the yarn.”</p>

<p>“We wish you would,” said Ralph, scenting a
story out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>“Well, it happened a dozen winters ago,” began
Trooper Carthew, “and it must be fifteen since
I’ve seen Jim. Time slips by here in the mountains.
Well, as Jim here said, Nevins was a
man who ought never to have gone into the
Mounted. He was a nervous, harum-scarum
kind of man. I don’t know where he came from
or what made him join, but anyhow there he was,
and it fell to my lot to look after him.</p>

<p>“We were sent on detachment duty up to a
place called Bear Rock. Jim knows where it is,
and as you don’t, the best way I can describe it
to you is to say that a one-horse board-and-canvas
town anywhere in the wilds you’ve a mind to
place it, would have been a metropolis alongside
of it.</p>

<p>“There were a few Cree Indians around&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
forgot to say it was up in the Yukon Country&mdash;and
that was all the society we had. Not even
skin thieves or horse rustlers ever came up there.
It was too poor pickin’s even for them.</p>

<p>“Things began to go wrong the first winter.
I saw that the loneliness of it all was beginning
to prey on young Nevins’ nerves. I call him
young, but I expect he was older than he looked.
Mind you, he never said anything in the way of
complaint, but I’d seen men go that way before,
and I saw that he was not built for the job. I
tried to get him to go back to division headquarters
and report sick, or ask to be transferred
or something. But he was a proud cuss, and ‘No,’
says he, ‘I’ll stick it out.’</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ve never been stuck off in the
Yukon, sixty miles from any place, with a man
whom you suspect is beginning to get snow madness,
you’ve no idea what a business it is. Nevins
had a nice little habit of getting up in the middle
of the night and saying that he saw faces looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
at him through the window, and voices calling
down the chimney, and little things like that.</p>

<p>“By the middle of the second winter he got so
bad that it began to get on my nerves, too, and
I’d begun to look about and listen and think I
heard things. I soon saw that this wouldn’t do,
and so decided to ride into White Lake, the
nearest station, and explain matters. Besides,
Nevins was really in need of a doctor. His face
was drawn and pale and he could hardly be
trusted out by himself on the trail, for he was
always shooting at something or other that he
thought he saw, but which wasn’t there at all.
Oh, he was a bad case, I tell you. I began to
be scared that some night he might take a fancy
to get up and shoot at me. I began to lose sleep
and get pretty nearly as peaked as he was.</p>

<p>“When I broke the news to him that we were
going back to the station he got mad as a hornet.
He was no kid, he said. He could stick it out.
All he wanted was to shoot the enemies that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
after him, and then he’d be all right. I quieted
him down by telling him that our time at the
post was up anyhow, and that we were due to report
back at White Lake without delay.</p>

<p>“As soon as he saw, as he thought, that we
were not leaving on his account he brightened
up wonderfully. He took an interest in getting
the shack in order for the next comers and talked
about our trip almost all night. I patted myself
on the back. He seemed like a cured man already,
and when we started out with our parkees on
our backs and our snow shoes on our feet, you’d
have thought that there wasn’t a thing the matter
with him.</p>

<p>“Sometimes there was a queer glitter in his
eyes, though, that showed me that he wasn’t as
right as he seemed to be by any means, and that
a doctor and some companionship were needed
before a thorough cure could be effected. As we
left the shack he turned and shook his fist at it
without saying a word, but his face showed me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
how much he had suffered there and how glad
he was to be saying good-by to it all.</p>

<p>“Mushing, as they call traveling in the Yukon,
is slow work on a broken trail, and that one from
the shack to White Lake was about as bad a
specimen as I ever traveled over. But Nevins
didn’t seem to mind it. He was so eager to get
back to civilization&mdash;as if you could call White
Lake civilization&mdash;that he was always ahead of
me. But I didn’t like his gait. It was awkward,
zig-zaggy, not the trail of a man who is sure of
himself. Nevins was living on his nerves. I
caught myself praying they didn’t explode before
we reached White Lake!</p>

<p>“Once I offered to take a turn at breaking the
trail. But, ‘No, what do you think I am? A
baby?’ says he angrily, and after that we plugged
along in silence. Nevins’ head was poked forward
and he appeared to be in a desperate hurry
to get along, almost as if he was afraid something
was after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘You’ll blow up if you don’t slow down,
Nevins,’ I said once, but he only made an irritable
reply and kept right on.</p>

<p>“I began to be worried. If he did break down
I would be in a nasty fix. I’d seen snow madness
before and knew what it was. That night I
fairly forced him to halt. He was getting so
crazy that he wanted to keep on in the dark, but
I stuck out at that and he finally quieted down.
Yet every now and then as we ate our sough-dough
flap-jacks and gulped down our tea before
turning in, I saw him keep looking back along
the trail we’d come, as if he was scared somebody
or something was coming after him to take
him back to that shack.</p>

<p>“The next day we mushed on, Nevins still in
the lead. We were due at the Lake that night,
but I began to doubt if Nevins would make it.
He started to talk and mutter to himself, and
finally he turned around on me and asked me if
I heard anything coming after us down the trail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
I laughed the thing off as best I could, but I tell
you it’s no joke being out in those wilds with a
snow-crazed man, especially when he has a rifle,
and maybe might take a crazy notion to try his
marksmanship in your direction! I watched
Nevins mighty close, you can bet.</p>

<p>“At noon we stopped and ate a half frozen
meal, with Nevins staring back up the trail. As
we resumed our march he was still muttering to
himself and I noticed that he was fumbling with
his rifle in a way that was not at all reassuring.
I tried to get him to give it to me, making the
excuse that it would lighten his load. He looked
at me cunningly.</p>

<p>“‘I half believe that you’re in league with
those fellows that want to take me back to that
shack,’ says he, in a way that made me feel sick,
for I knew then that he was crazy, sure enough&mdash;and
me alone with an armed maniac and miles
from any human being!”</p>

<p class="pch">THE TROOPER’S STORY.</p>

<p>“However, I put the best face I could on the
matter and even tried to talk cheerfully to Nevins.
But he would have none of my conversation and
zig-zagged along on his snow shoes with his
queer, swinging gait in the same silent way. It
began to grow dusk, and I saw that we should
never make the lake that night. I halted Nevins
and told him so.</p>

<p>“He gave an odd kind of laugh.</p>

<p>“‘Not make it? Man alive. I’m going to make
it’ he grated out in an odd, rasping sort of a
voice.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t talk like a fool,’ said I. ‘Come, here’s
a place under this ledge that’ll make a good camp,
and bright and early we’ll hit the trail again.’</p>

<p>“He whipped round on me with blazing eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
If ever a demon shone out of a man’s optics it
blazed out of his.</p>

<p>“‘I’m going on, I tell you,’ he snarled, ‘and
what’s more, you’re going with me.’</p>

<p>“I’ve been in some pretty tight places, but take
my word for it, right then I began to think that
I hadn’t begun to know what a tight corner was.
I could see by the way that poor crazy Nevins
gripped his rifle that he meant to have company
on his night ‘mush,’ even if he had to shoot him
to get it. I felt as if somebody had dropped a
chunk of ice down my back.</p>

<p>“‘All right, Nevins,’ I said, ‘I’ll go along.
Don’t get excited.’</p>

<p>“‘I’m not excited,’ he said. And then he
added, ‘It’s only that they’ll get us if we don’t
keep on going.’</p>

<p>“‘Who’s them?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>“‘Those things that have been following us,’
he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then he came quite close to me and caught my
arm.</p>

<p>“‘They live back there up in the snow, and
they’re trying to get me and take me back with
them, but they won’t.’ He broke into a wild
laugh that made my scalp tighten till I could
almost feel my hat lift on my hair.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t talk nonsense, Nevins,’ I snapped.
‘We’re far ahead of them. They’ll never catch
us now.’</p>

<p>“He looked sharply at me.</p>

<p>“‘You’re more of a fool than I thought you,’
he said contemptuously. ‘They’ve been following
us all day. They’re close behind us now!’</p>

<p>“I confess that his manner was such that I
jumped nervously and looked behind me as he
spoke. Of course there was nothing there but
the trail, and I told him so, but a contemptuous
laugh was all that I got.</p>

<p>“Well, in the course of my career as a trooper
I’ve handled some pretty bad characters and been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
into some tight places and faced some situations
where things looked mighty bad, but I never felt
such a feeling of real scare as I had at that
moment. Having made this outburst, Nevins
started off again. After a while, when it began
to get dark, I determined to make a last try to
check his crazy plan. I stopped dead.</p>

<p>“‘Here’s where I stop, Nevins,’ I said. ‘I’m
dead beat.’</p>

<p>“He faced round like a wild man, and before
I could lift a hand he had his rifle raised, and
with the yell of a maniac he fired blindly in my
direction. I felt the bullet fan my ear.</p>

<p>“‘What on earth are you trying to do, Nevins?’
I asked in as firm a voice as I could assume, but
I’m afraid it was as wobbly as a dish of jelly.
‘Are you crazy?’</p>

<p>“‘Crazy!’ he echoed with a wild laugh. ‘It’s
you that are crazy. Come on, follow me. I’ll
save you from those creatures that are after us.’</p>

<p>“There was nothing to do but to obey. Up I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
got and started on again after Nevins, who went
staggering along, edging from side to side of the
trail like a dizzy man. I found myself wondering
how it was all going to end. I’m pretty tough
and hard to tire, but I felt almost all in, and
Nevins, not nearly so strong as I was, must have
been going solely on the unnatural strength lent
him by his insanity.</p>

<p>“By and by it got dark, but Nevins kept on.
He kept shouting back at me, and I’d answer
him from time to time. I couldn’t let him go
on alone, although I was almost dead. After a
while his shouts grew less frequent and finally
they died out altogether. I guessed what had
probably happened. I thought that by and by
if I kept on I would stumble over his body lying
in the snow.</p>

<p>“For a long time I walked slowly, every minute
expecting to come upon him, but he was nowhere
on the trail. I don’t like to recall that night nor
the next day when I went on staggering down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the trail till I began to get crazy, too, and hear
odd things and voices.</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been that a party from the station
out hunting found me I don’t like to think of
what might have happened. I soon came round
and told all I could about Nevins. A search party
started out at once, but returned the next day
empty-handed. They had found and then lost
tracks of many snow shoes in the woods near the
trail. We always suspected that Nevins had
wandered off the trail when I missed him, been
found dead by Blood Indians, robbed and buried
in a drift.... And that, boys, is one incident
in the life of a trooper of the Mounted.”</p>

<p>“It’s a ghastly story,” shuddered Ralph, while
the others looked grave and sober.</p>

<p>“Chum around with a bunch of troopers some
time and you’ll hear stranger yarns than that,”
said Trooper Carthew. “And,” he added thoughtfully,
knocking the ashes out of his pipe, “the
worst of it is, they are all true. There’s no need
to do any fancy color work on ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after, the trooper rose with the remark
that he must “mush along.” The party
intended moving on, too, so they rode with him
till their trails parted. The last they saw of
Trooper Carthew was his broad back as his horse
surmounted a brow of the trail and disappeared.
He turned in his saddle and waved, and then was
gone.</p>

<p>It was a new experience to the boys and it was
long before they forgot his story, but such men
are met with frequently in the wild places. Real
heroes, worthy of world recognition, die fighting
a good fight, without hope of reward or praise
beyond that bestowed by their mates.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">AFTER MOUNTAIN GOATS.</p>

<p>The two days following were unmarked by any
special incident. Jimmie rode with the boys, becoming
stronger and lighter-hearted every day.
And yet they noticed a curious thing about the
waif. Whenever the mysterious man was spoken
of he grew somber and silent. It was as if some
link existed between himself and this wanderer
of the mountains. The boys put this down to
the fact that possibly Jimmie felt that, like himself,
this outcast of the hills was friendless and
alone.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the second day that
they made camp beside one of those beautiful
little lakes that nestle in the bosom of the mighty
Rockies. Across the sheet of blue water the
color of turquoise, a ridge rose steeply from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
very water’s edge. The pines on it were thinner
than usual, and appeared singularly free from
underbrush. Far above the lake the smooth
ascent broke off abruptly, and there appeared to
be beyond it a rocky plateau intervening between
it and the farther wall of rock and snow that
piled upward till it seemed to brush the sky.</p>

<p>While they were making camp Persimmons
was gazing about and suddenly he drew Ralph’s
attention to some moving objects on the snow-covered
crest above the plateau. Mountain Jim
was appealed to and decided that the objects were
mountain goats.</p>

<p>“A big herd of them, too,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Have a look through the binoculars,” urged
Ralph, borrowing the professor’s glasses which
he was far too busy with his rock specimens to
use. Indeed, he hailed Ralph’s excited announcement
with only mild interest, being at that
moment entering in his note-book a voluminous
account of his discovery of some metamorphic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
rock in a region where none was thought previously
to exist.</p>

<p>The glasses revealed the objects as mountain
goats beyond a doubt. They were big, white
fellows with high, humped shoulders and delicate
hind quarters and black hoofs and horns. They
looked not unlike miniature bisons, although of
course the resemblance was only superficial.</p>

<p>While they still gazed at the moving objects
on the snow-capped ridge, Mountain Jim suddenly
uttered a sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>“Look close now,” said he, “for you’ll see something
worth looking at in a minute or two, or I
miss my guess.”</p>

<p>The goats were at the summit of what appeared
to be an absolutely precipitous rock wall. From
where they watched it did not appear that a fly
could have found foothold on its surface. The
goats had paused. Ralph drew in a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Gracious! I do believe they are going to try
to get down it,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“And that ain’t all,” declared Mountain Jim.
“They’re going to succeed, too. Watch ’em.”</p>

<p>The leader of the goats gave a leap that must
have been fully twenty feet to a ridge which
was hardly perceptible even through the glasses.
He stood poised there for a second and then made
a breath-catching plunge off into space. The
place on the ledge that he had just vacated was
immediately occupied by one of his followers,
while he himself found footing on nothing, so
far as the boys could see. It was a thrilling performance
to watch the goats as they made their
way down that rock-face to the feeding grounds.
Sometimes the leader would take a leap that
would make the performance of a flying squirrel
seem tame by comparison. And his followers,
among them some ewes, were by no means behind
him in feats of agility.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen ’em come down a gully that looked
like a chimney with one side out,” said Mountain
Jim as he watched. “Old hunters say that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
they miss their footing they save their heads from
being caved in by landing on their horns, but I
don’t take any stock in that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t they ever miss their footing?” cried
Ralph wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve traveled aroun’ these parts fer a
good many years,” replied Jim judicially, “and
I ain’t never found hair nor hide of a carcass
killed that way, and no more I reckon did anybody
else.”</p>

<p>Jim went on to describe to the boys how wise
and cunning the mountain goats are, gifted with
an intelligence far beyond that possessed by most
wild creatures. He also related to them an
anecdote concerning an ewe whom he had seen
defend her kid from the attack of an eagle. The
eagle had swooped down on the kid and knocked
it head over heels. It was about to fix its talons
into the fleecy coat and fly off to its eerie with
the little creature, when the old mother became
aware of what was going on. Like a thunderbolt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
she charged down on the eagle, which tried in
vain to get away. But its own greediness proved
its undoing, for its talons were tangled in the
young goat’s coat and it could not rise, and the
mother speedily tramped and butted it to death.
While she was doing this some old rams looked
on as if it were no concern of theirs. They
seemed to know that the mother was quite able
to fight her own battles.</p>

<p>“Think there’s any chance of our getting a
shot at them?” asked young Ware, vibrant with
excitement.</p>

<p>“Don’t see why not,” responded Mountain Jim.
“It’s not a hard climb up there, and I reckon
they’ll stay there till to-morrow anyhow, as
there’s pasturage and grass on the plateau and
they’re working down to it.”</p>

<p>The professor demurred at first at allowing the
boys to go hunting the goats, but after Jim had
promised to bring them back safe and sound he
gave his consent. Early the next day, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the party set out, leaving only Jimmie and the
professor in camp. Jimmie had by this time become
quite a valuable assistant to the scientist,
and the quiet occupation of collecting specimens
appeared to suit him far better than the more
strenuous sports the rugged boys enjoyed.</p>

<p>For a couple of hours, after skirting the little
lake, they climbed steadily. Up they went among,
apparently, endless banks of climbing pines, and
traversed strips of loose gravel here and there
that sent clattering pebbles down the slope under
their feet.</p>

<p>Then they left the last of the dwindling pine
belt behind them and pushed along on a slope
strewn with broken rock and debris that made
walking arduous.</p>

<p>“Great sport this, hunting mountain goats,
ain’t it, boys?” said Jim with a grin as the boys
begged him to rest a while, for Jim appeared to
be made of chilled steel and gristle when it came
to climbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m all right,” declared Harry Ware stoutly,
although his panting sides and streaming face
belied his words, “but how about lunch?”</p>

<p>“Yes, cantering crackers! I’m hungry as one
of those lions that tried to gobble up Ralph,”
declared Persimmons, who always had, as may
have been noticed, an excellent appetite.</p>

<p>“Don’t be thinking of lunch yet,” admonished
Jim. “You’re a fine bunch of hunters. The first
thing we want to do is to get a crack at those
goats, ain’t it? If we don’t keep on, they will.”</p>

<p>That settled the question of lunch, and after a
brief rest they kept pushing on up the mountain
side. A chill wind was now blowing from the
vast snowfields, and the cool of it fanned their
flushed cheeks refreshingly.</p>

<p>They reached a stretch of rocky ground made
smooth and slippery by melting snow from the
ridges above. The scrap broke off on the verge
of an almost precipitous rift, in the depths of
which a torrent roared. They stopped for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
minute upon the dizzy ledge of rock and gazed
down above battalions of somber trees upon the
lake below. They could see the camp and the
ponies, dwarfed to specks, moving about far beneath.
Harry Ware and Percy Simmons shouted
and waved their hats, but Jim instantly checked
this.</p>

<p>“Are you hunting goats or out on a picnic,”
he admonished the abashed boys.</p>

<p>“Huh! Not much of a picnic about this,”
grunted Hardware in an audible aside.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, it will get worse before it gets
better,” said Ralph with a laugh.</p>

<p>A short distance further on they came upon
some green grass growing in a marshy spot, kept
damp by the constant running of silvery threads
of melted snow.</p>

<p>“Now look to your rifles,” warned Jim. “We’ll
be using the shooting irons before long, or I miss
my guess.”</p>

<p>They crept cautiously forward, taking advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of every bit of cover they could find. They
were above timber line now, and only a few
scattered bits of brush or big rocks afforded them
the hiding places they desired.</p>

<p>It was after they had been crouching behind
a big rock for some minutes that Mountain Jim,
who had just peered over the top, brought them
to their feet with a whisper that electrified them.</p>

<p>“They’re coming,” he said, in a voice that was
tense with a hunter’s excitement, “don’t move or
make a sound, and they’ll come right on top of
us.”</p>

<p>The wind was blowing from the goats toward
the hunters, and the magnificent animals appeared
to have no idea of what lay in store for
them beyond the rocks where the boys crouched.
There were twenty or more of the goats, including
several bucks, great snow-white creatures of
regal mien with splendid horns and coats. The
boys were conscious of an almost painful excitement
as they waited.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jim, like a good general, knew when to
hold his fire. Peering through a crevice in the
rocks he watched the advance of the stately
creatures. They appeared in no hurry, and under
the mighty snow-covered shoulder of the
mountain they moved along serenely, cropping
the grass and from time to time skipping about
playfully.</p>

<p>“Now!” shouted Mountain Jim suddenly.</p>

<p>Like one lad the three boys leaped to their
feet. Four rifles cracked and two of the goats
sprang into the air and crashed down again dead.
Both Harry Ware and Persimmons had missed
their marks. The goats wheeled in wild confusion.
They snorted and snorted and mah-h-hed
in a terrified manner. With a whoop Percy Simmons
dashed toward them, yelling at the top of
his voice.</p>

<p>“Come back!” roared Jim frantically, but the
boy was far too excited to heed him. He rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
after the fleeing goats at top speed, shouting
like an Indian.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the old bucks wheeled. The
creature was as big as a small calf, and almost
as powerful as an ox. It saw Percy and lowered
its head.</p>

<p>“Gibbering gondolas! He’s coming for me!”
exclaimed the boy, and so indeed the infuriated
old buck was.</p>

<p>“Fire at him!” roared the others, seeing the
boy’s predicament, but Persimmons could only
stare stupidly at the great buck, as with lowered
horns, it dashed toward him.</p>

<p>“Run! Shoot! Do something!” came from Jim
in a volley of shouts.</p>

<p>“Look out!” roared Hardware, as if such a
warning was necessary at all.</p>

<p>“Get out of his way!” cried Ralph.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">JIMMIE FINDS A FATHER.</p>

<p>The goat itself simplified matters for the
frightened boy. Its lowered head collided with
his rotund form like a battering ram, and the
next instant Persimmons described a graceful
parabola above the snowfield. As for the goat,
it dashed on, but came to a sudden halt as a
shot cracked from Jim’s rifle and the bullet sped
to its heart.</p>

<p>The boys, however, paid little attention to this
at the time. Their minds were concentrated
upon poor Persimmons’ predicament. The boy
had been hurtled head foremost into a pile of
snow and all that was visible of him were his
two feet feebly waving in the air.</p>

<p>“Gracious, I hope he’s not badly hurt!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Ralph, as he and the rest ran toward
the snow bank.</p>

<p>Thanks to the soft snow, the lad was found
to be uninjured, and after he had been hauled
out, he sat down on a rock with a comically rueful
expression on his face, and picked the snow
out of his hair and eyes.</p>

<p>“What do you think you are, anyhow,” demanded
Harry, “a bullfighter?”</p>

<p>“Ouch, don’t joke about it,” protested the boy.
“I thought an express train had hit me.
Wh-wh-what became of the buck?”</p>

<p>“There he lies yonder, dead as that rock, but
I don’t see where you come in for any credit for
killing him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh? Didn’t I attract him this way
so you could shoot him?” demanded the other
youth indignantly. “I’ll tell you, fellows, shooting
the chutes, the loop-the-loop and all of them
can take a back seat. For pure unadulterated,
blown-in-the-bottle excitement, give me a butt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
by a mountain goat. It’s like riding in an airship.”</p>

<p>“If you ever take another such ride it may
prove your last one, young man,” spoke Mountain
Jim severely.</p>

<p>“Yes; I wouldn’t advise you to get the habit,”
commented Harry Ware.</p>

<p>Not long after, they watched Jim separate the
fine heads of the three dead animals, and, as
it proved, there was one for Harry Ware, after
all. Mountain Jim had shot so many of the
goats in his time that a head more or less meant
nothing to him, and he gladly gave his to Harry
when he saw the latter’s rather long face.</p>

<p>They took the choicest parts of the meat back
to camp with them. Not all of a mountain goat
is very good eating, some of the flesh being
strong flavored and coarse, so that they had no
more than they could easily carry amongst them.
That night, as you may imagine, Persimmons
“rode the goat” all over again amidst much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
laughter and applause, and the other young
hunters told their stories till they all grew so
sleepy that it was decided to turn in.</p>

<p>Three days of traveling amidst the big peaks
followed, and they all helped the professor collect
specimens to his heart’s content. His note books
were soon bulging, and he declared that his trip
had added much to the knowledge of the world
concerning the Canadian Rockies.</p>

<p>One evening as they mounted a ridge, Mountain
Jim paused and pointed down to the valley
below them. Through it swept a great green
ribbon of water amidst rocky, pine-clad slopes.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” declared Jim.</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Persimmons eagerly, not
quite understanding.</p>

<p>“The Big Bend of the Columbia River,” was
the rejoinder.</p>

<p>The party broke into a cheer. The end of one
stage of their journey was at hand, for they
were to return by a more civilized route. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
yet they were half sorry, for they had enjoyed
themselves to the full in those last days amidst
the great silences.</p>

<p>It is at the Big Bend that the mighty Columbia
turns after its erratic northeast course and
starts its southern journey to the Pacific Ocean,
which it enters near Portland, Oregon.</p>

<p>In the sunset light, which lay glowingly on
the great peaks behind them, the heart of whose
mysteries they had penetrated, they rode rapidly
down the trail, sweeping up to the store in a
grand manner. That night they had an elaborate
supper and related some of their adventures
to the store-keeper, a French Canadian,
who, in turn, told many of his experiences. They
were still talking when a man came in and announced
himself as Bill Dawkins from “up the
trail a ways.”</p>

<p>“I heard that one of your party is a doctor or
suthin’ sim’lar,” he said, “and maybe he can do
suth’in for a poor cuss that’s just been throwed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
from his horse and had his head busted, up the
road a piece.”</p>

<p>“I am not a doctor, but I have some knowledge
of medicine,” said the professor. “Where is the
man?”</p>

<p>“In my cabin. I’ll take you to him.”</p>

<p>They all streamed out into the night and followed
Bill Dawkins up the trail. It was not a
great way and they were soon standing at the
bedside of a well-built, but pitifully ragged-looking
man. His head was bandaged, but enough
of his face was visible to cause Ralph to give
a great start as they saw him.</p>

<p>“It’s the mysterious man! The horse thief!”
he cried, clutching Mountain Jim’s arm.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Certain.”</p>

<p>Jim turned to the man who had brought them.</p>

<p>“Is the horse that threw him outside?” he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure, pard’ner, right under the shed,” was
the reply; “good-looking pony, too.”</p>

<p>Jim borrowed a lantern and he and Ralph
went out. There was no question about it. One
look was enough. It was the missing pony.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I call poetic justice,” said
Jim.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Ralph suddenly. “What was
that?”</p>

<p>“Somebody hollered,” declared Jim; “it came
from the hut. Maybe that scallywag is dead.”</p>

<p>Ralph set off running. The cry had been in
Jimmie’s voice. He had recognized it. What
could have happened?</p>

<p>Inside the hut there was a strange scene.
Jimmie was on his knees at the bedside of the
wild-looking man and was crying out:</p>

<p>“Father! It’s me! Jimmie! Father, don’t you
know me?”</p>

<p>But the man on the bed was delirious. He
shouted incoherently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s silver! I tell you it’s silver! Jimmie?
Who says Jimmie? Why, that’s my boy. But
he’s dead, is Jimmie. Dead-dead-dead!”</p>

<p>The cracked voice broke off in a wail. Suddenly
the delirious man thrust his hands into
his pockets and drew out some fragments of
rock.</p>

<p>“Scramble for it, you dogs!” he cried. “It’s
silver! Jimmie’s dead and I don’t want it. But
they’re after me,&mdash;after me yet!”</p>

<p>The professor picked up a bit of the rock.</p>

<p>“It’s rich in fine silver!” he exclaimed. “This
man has found a mine somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but Jimmie called him ‘father.’ What
does it all mean?” demanded Ralph.</p>

<p>“It must remain a puzzle for the present,” said
the professor. “This man has been badly injured
in his fall. I think he will live, but I can’t
answer for it. Bill Dawkins’ partner has ridden
off for a doctor. In the meantime. I’ll do what
I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon afterward the doctor arrived and they
were all ordered from the room. It was then
that Jimmie told his story to the curious group
that surrounded him.</p>

<p>His father, whom he had so strangely recovered,
had been cashier of a city bank many years
before, when Jimmie was a baby. Before that
he had followed the sea for a time, and sailor
fashion, he had had tattooed on his arms his
own initials,&mdash;H. R., Horace Ransom,&mdash;and the
initials of Jimmie’s mother,&mdash;A. S., Anna Seagrim.
There came a day when shortage was discovered
in the bank and Jimmie’s father, wrongfully
suspected, fled to Canada rather than face
the chance of being convicted, as he knew that
had happened to many another innocent man.</p>

<p>Beyond the fact that he had gone to the Canadian
Rockies, then a wilder region even than
they are to-day, Jimmie’s mother knew nothing.
Time went on and it was found out that Horace
Ransom was innocent, but he could not be found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Jimmie’s mother fell ill and died, but before she
passed away she left a paper with her son describing
the marks on his father’s arm and where
he had last been heard of.</p>

<p>Jimmie was too young to understand what it
all meant then. He was sent to an orphans’
home, but ran away as soon as he was old enough
to make his escape. He drifted about, selling
newspapers, performing with circuses and doing
many other things, but all the time he clung to
the precious bit of paper his mother had entrusted
to him. Jimmie’s one ambition had been
to find his father if he were alive, and to make
him happy. He saved and scrimped and at last
got money enough together for railroad fares
back to the States for his father and himself.
But he had, as we know, to make his way to the
Rockies without financial assistance, traveling
as best he could.</p>

<p>The boys’ stories of the wild man had worked
on his imagination and a feeling that the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
might be his father had come to possess him.
But, of course, he had no proof of the matter
till he knelt at the bedside of the raving man and
saw the tattoo marks. Such, in brief, was Jimmie’s
strange story.</p>

<p>With this, our party had to be content for the
time being, and leaving Jimmie with the neighborhood
doctor at Bill Dawkins’ hut, they went
down the trail to pitch camp at the Big Bend.
They decided to remain at this place at least
until Jimmie’s new-found father was out of danger
and his plans for the future were made.</p>

<p>Some days later Mr. Ransom rallied enough
to talk haltingly,&mdash;and to Jimmie’s joy he talked
rationally! The surgeon in attendance declared
that, as is not altogether unusual, the sudden
blow on the head had restored the man’s
senses. He felt assured that some particularly
severe experience during Mr. Ransom’s years of
loneliness and hardship in the Rockies had deprived
him temporarily of his mental poise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
that he had been subject to periods of wildness.</p>

<p>What the crucial strain was, no one could discover.
He seemed very uncertain when questioned
about his past and apparently was unable
to relate one incident to another as he recalled
them.</p>

<p>It was left for Jimmie, who could hardly be
tempted to leave his father’s bedside, by day or
night, to tell him of his early history and to piece
together the later experiences as they fell from
the injured man’s lips.</p>

<p>It seemed that Mr. Ransom had accidentally
blundered upon the boys’ camp on one of his lone
pilgrimages amidst the mountains, for doubtless
he had searched only during his sane periods for
gold or silver. The sound of boyish voices had
evidently stirred memories of his own son, Jimmie,
who he had realized must be a grown lad,
although he had left him a baby in arms.</p>

<p>But the fear of being arrested for the crime
of which, as he supposed, he still stood accused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
always haunted him and had made him afraid of
meeting the travelers from the States face to
face. He had followed them at a distance, his
half-crazed brain fascinated by them. In the
terrible passage of the <i>brulee</i> his own pony had
died under him, and the next night he had stampeded
the travelers’ ponies and stolen one of
them. In the same way, when necessity arose,
he had stolen some of their provisions. He was
still on their trail when the accident that restored
to him his son, his senses and the knowledge of
his complete clearance of suspicion of the bank
shortage, had occurred to him.</p>

<p>But still he could not account for years of his
past. Jimmie patiently went over with him the
story of his long-ago flight and of his recent
mining researches, but between the two experiences
yawned a baffling hiatus.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE MYSTERY SOLVED.</p>

<p>One day the two were sitting in the doorway
of Bill Dawkins’ hut, where the hospitable owner
still made them welcome. They were looking
over the few specimens of rock “rich in fine silver”
that Mr. Ransom had produced that first
day, when the man thrust his hands into his
pockets to see if any more fragments remained
there. Finally from an inside pocket he added
to the growing pile of treasures a piece of flat,
tarnished metal. He gave a little shudder as his
fingers released it, and Jimmie glanced up in
time to see a sudden change in his father’s eye,
like a glimpse of suddenly remembered fear.</p>

<p>“What is it, father?” Jimmie cried sharply.</p>

<p>The man started, looked down and then smiled
foolishly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know, son,” he replied slowly.</p>

<p>Jimmie picked up the bit of tarnished metal,
and gave a sudden start in his turn. Quickly
controlling himself, he asked as quietly as possible,
“Where did you get this, father?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, son,” repeated the man again.
“I don’t know. I must have had it a long time,&mdash;son,&mdash;a
long time.”</p>

<p>Jimmie looked at the little dull article a moment
and then leaning forward fastened it to
the breast of his father’s coat. Mr. Ransom began
to look uneasy and a wild light sprang to
his eyes for an instant. Jimmie immediately detached
the metal piece and put it in his pocket.
Then he began to chat with his father about the
trees, the mountains, the hut and kindred matters,
and apparently forgot all about the incident.</p>

<p>But the moment that Bill Dawkins returned
from his day’s hunting in the mountains, Jimmie
was off like an arrow from a bow for the camp
down on the Big Bend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The party were just enjoying a quiet evening
meal prepared under Mountain Jim’s tutelage,
when Jimmie burst in upon them.</p>

<p>“See that!” he cried breathlessly, holding up
the piece of tarnished metal. “And that!” he
added, turning the article over so as to show its
blackened under side.</p>

<p>“It’s a badge!” cried Persimmons.</p>

<p>“A Northwest Mounted badge!” added Ralph.</p>

<p>“And it has a name scratched on the back!”
reported the professor.</p>

<p>“And the name&mdash;is&mdash;<i>Nevins</i>!” concluded
Mountain Jim in a tone of awe.</p>

<p>“And <i>my father</i> had that in his pocket!” said
Jimmie, tears of excitement rolling down his
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Could your father&mdash;possibly&mdash;be&mdash;Nevins?”
asked the professor slowly.</p>

<p>“But Nevins died in the snow!” protested
Harry Ware.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, Carthew only <i>thought</i> he died. No one
<i>knew</i>,” said Mountain Jim reminiscently.</p>

<p>“But the Indians?” suggested Ralph.</p>

<p>“Maybe they saved him,&mdash;who knows?” said
Jimmie, his eyes shining. “And maybe they let
him wander away when he got stronger because
they saw he was crazy!”</p>

<p>And so the talk went on, one suggestion and
one surmise following another until the long
evening was spent. The mystery could not be
fully solved, but all agreed not to remind Jimmie’s
father of the horrible experience that had
been his, if he were, indeed, the subject of
Trooper Carthew’s tale.</p>

<p>The next day the faithful doctor approved this
decision. He also promised that he would get
word to the trooper of this strange sequel to his
story.</p>

<p>To digress, for a moment, as we may not
linger much longer over the happy ending of
Jimmie’s search. Time and the trooper proved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
that Mr. Ransom and “Nevins of Ours” were,
indeed, one and the same. The second name had
been assumed as a protection, and so had prevented
the finding of Jimmie’s father long ago.
A year or two after the incidents just related
there was a reunion of the two men who had
long before faced death together on the solitary
trail, and by that time the clouds of forgetfulness
had been so largely dissipated from Mr.
Ransom’s befogged brain that he was able to
thank the stalwart trooper for his efforts in his
behalf.</p>

<p>Although much that had intervened between
the time of Mr. Ransom’s disappearance in the
snow and the time of his mental recovery was
never clearly known, yet flashes of memory recalled
to him Indians, warm blankets and good
food. And his friends concluded that the Indians
had really captured and saved him, but
through some superstitious regard for his crazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
condition, had been kindly disposed toward him
and given him his freedom.</p>

<p>But the silver? It was many days before
Horace Ransom was strong enough to compel
his brain to work backward to locate the spot
where he had found the rich ore. Finally he
succeeded, and the professor and the boys eventually
accompanied him to the recess in the hills
where the rich find had been made. The professor
declared that the vein was of great richness
and would yield a vast amount of silver,
and so it subsequently proved.</p>

<p>The new Horace Ransom&mdash;the alert, middle-aged
man of property that had arisen from the
ashes of the mysterious derelict of the mountains&mdash;was
anxious for the boys and the professor
all to take shares in his mine, but they
refused. Instead they turned their interest,
which Mr. Ransom insisted they possessed, over
to Mountain Jim.</p>

<p>All this, of course, did not take place in a day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
While Mr. Ransom was convalescing, the boys
had much sport on the great Columbia in native
canoes. They also had several adventurous
hunting trips and memorable mountain climbs.
But possibly of all their recollections of the Canadian
Rockies the remembrance of the strange
reunion of “the boy from nowhere” and his
father was destined to stand out as the brightest
and best. Little did they imagine when Ralph
rescued Jimmie from the hands of the brutal
brakeman, that before many years had rolled by
the waif would be partner in the “Border Boy”
silver mine, answering to the name “Mr. James
Ransom.”</p>

<p>And here we will break off this tale. Another
volume might easily be written relating further
doings of these boys in the Canadian Rockies.
But space forbids, and we must defer further acquaintance
with our lads till we meet them once
more in the next volume of this series, <span class="smcap">The Border
Boys on the St. Lawrence</span>.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
